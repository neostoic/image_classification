  "text" : "If you enjoy a little people watching with your dining, sit out on the outside terrace and watch Las Vegas tourist walk the strip as they celebrate their winnings or rave about the fabulous Bellagio fountains.  As the restaurant is directly across from the fountains, it is also a great place to dine while taking in the free show.   The food fits the setting, with a traditional French menu infused with a bit of Vegas penache.   We had excellent service..polite, prompt, helpful (great at helping us pick a great wine suited to our selections!) and personal.   And by the way,   the wait staff aren't above snapping that great snapshot of you and your guest having a good time....it is great to be a tourist!"

First off, I loved eating in the atrium (light, airy and classic), and probably prefered it to eating outside (who wants to feel like they're right on the strip amidst icky large groups and las vegas grime while spending a bit for brunch?).  Secondly, the service was OUTSTANDING.  The waitress even put in a special request for a specific  crepe filling not on the menu (the kitchen made it- smoked salmon, egg and jack cheese if you're curious).  Crepes were enormous and delicious (just too bad I couldn't lug a doggie bag around with me all day).  Not too expensive ($50 with tax and tip and champagne) .Yumyumyum. Will definatley go again."

Half of the group did the same.  The dish was in a nice wine reduction mushroom sauce and sauteed spinach.

This is perhaps the only restaurant that allows you to sit outside & view the beautiful Bellagio Musical Fountain show (every 15 minutes or so), while enjoying fine gourmet French-American cuisine.\n\nI'd give it 5 stars, except for the following few reasons:\n1. it is slightly on the noisy side (being on the busy 10-lane Las Vegas Blvd S)\n2. It takes more than an hour to get seated outside, due to the popularity.\n3. Some of the waiters are not very friendly or personable. Especially this one guy called Kareem: he is too moody for a waiter at a French restaurant. And unpredictable... He snapped at me in a very unkind way for simply telling him we're ready to order \"why- are you in a hurry?\" No, I am not in a hurry, but we waited over 80 minutes to sit here! \"Well I have so many customers before you\". I guess you must be overworked, Kareem- but it is none of my business. As far as I am concerned, you still need to treat me as a valued customer! I don't deserve to be given attitude in front of my lady. At a restaurant that costs $60 or more per person...\n\nOther than that... highly recommended!\n\nOur favorites here are:\n- Escargots Bernaise\n- Warm baguette bread\n- Delicious \"Market Salad\" with fresh tomatoes\n- Belgian Endive Salad (with blue cheese and pears).\n- Steak au Poivre (peppercorn wine sauce)- prepared medium\n- Red wine from Burgundy (around $7.50 per glass) sorry cannot recall the name :) - goes so well with the meat!\n- Creme Brulee - amazing\n- Tarte Tatin - apple & cinnamon- but ummm, so yummy, so warm, so sensual. Not your average apple cobbler!"

  "text" : "Vegas closes down early, and there aren't many decent places to eat on the later side.  And there are many things to steer away from at this restaurant.  The fries, for example.  They call these fries?  And yet, and yet . . . . There are some terrific wines, not horribly priced.  The steak au poivre is terrific, as good as any SF bistro (except for the frites which, frankly, suck).  The salads are executed poorly as to presentation, but the ingredients?  Actually pretty good.   For example, we had a serrano and mozzarella and fig salad.  Big old pile of the jambon, sliced too thickly, and there was no art in the presentation.  It looked like no one cared enough to make it pretty.  But the taste?  Quite good.  All very high end ingredients, and even the dressing was good.  Same with the heirloom tomato salad (flown in, who knew they cared) and the frisee with lardon.  \n\nSo if you order carefully and not on the outer limits of cuisine (you know, plain and simple, don't get creative), you'll get a good, maybe even a great, late-night meal.  Sit outside and it's perfect.  Just like Paris (except it's the Bellagio fountains and hordes of Americans, so maybe not so much like Paris, except it's outdoor bistro dining, so that's like Paris, right?)"

Actually I believe that is not the requirement that my girlfriend set next time we go back.\n\nSeating & Interiors - Inside is nice, but appears a little crowded and thus can get quite loud. Thankfully i sat outside..no wait at all for our table (we showed up at 6:30 pm and had a reservation through open table..15 minutes later, huge line outside the door).  The outside was very nice, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains (very romantic)...and even though it was slightly cold outside, they had a good amount of heaters outside to keep things regulated...was very nice outside.\n\nPricing - very, very fair. Considering most meals were $18-20..except for the $29 Filet Mignon Au Poivre I ordered...Starters were around $10 which is very good as well (hell, Chili's costs almost as much for appetizers)...I believe Desserts were around $8. The only thing slightly pricey were bottles of wine (cheapest bottles $28-35, everything else around $40-70).  Total price including (generous) tip for two people, two appetizers, one dessert, two entrees and a bottle of wine (remember i had the filet)..$128. \n\nService - SPECTACULAR. Our server Juan, was very articulate, friendly, on the ball with everything, and knowledgeable on all the foods.  Examples: it was slightly windy outside, my napkin fell, when i went to pick it up, he was there in an instant, picked it up, and told me he'd get me a clean one.  After eating our baguette, while crunching up he baguette paper, he was immediately at my side to pick up the trash, and offered another baguette. \n\nFood - The filet Mignon was delicious, my girlfriend's lemon chicken was perhaps the best chicken I've ever had. At first I was a little scared of having only an 8 ounce steak for fear of being hungry..but i came out quite full..the banana crepe was also delicious. Presentation was nice...although the escargot could've been presented better, but tasted delicious..The Lobster Bisque..was truly to die for.  The baguette was good as well..the Frites weren't my favorite type of frites, but still quite good, filling, crunchy, but with enough potato inside to make it more than a chip. \n\nOverall: The prices are very fair, I highly suggest sitting outside, the service is great ( at least my experience was tremendous). The food is awesome. I highly, highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi."

If you sit outside, you can spy on the streams of tourists passing by and watch (but not hear) the fountains of the Bellagio hotel across the street. Inside are darker rooms as well as a brightly lit atrium type room which lets in light but not so much the weather. \n\nOnion soup - very deep flavor; not a very thick broth, but not light. There is plenty of delicious Gruyre cheese on top and some onions in the soup. \n\nLobster bisque w/ orzo - a waiter brings a bowl with a few tiny chunks of lobster and 1/5 cup of orzo rice. Then he pours the lobster bisque out of a little pitcher. The lobster bisque has a slight seafood-y taste but I found it bearable. The bisque is also a little spicy which I really liked! \n\nSauted Spinach & Brie Crpe - a pretty large crepe with lots of brie and very fresh spinach. The crepe skin was a little dry and bland, but the brie and spinach made it better. The crepe also comes with a small side salad on the plate. \n\nClassic Quiche Lorraine,  with bacon - the BEST quiche I've had anywhere. It's creamy and eggy and the crust is tender and buttery. The Quiche Lorraine also comes with sweet, caramelized onions scattered throughout the quiche and lends a nice contrast to the salty elements. \n\nVegetable Quiche - same delicious eggy center and tender crust and contains spinach and mushrooms rather than bacon and onions. Liked the textures, but thought it wasn't as flavorful as the Quiche Lorraine. \n\nChicken & Brie Sandwich, caramelized onion and apple - this sandwich came on a soft ciabatta roll. The flavors were light but complemented each other well. The brie was mild and was delicious with the onions and the apples. The sweetness of the apples and onions paired well with the relatively tender chicken breast. Also came with a huge side order of Mon Ami's thin, crispy frites. I still personally prefer my steak fries, but fans of crispy fries should like the frites. Only problem was that some seemed to have been sitting around for a while."

In my opinion, that's really the best thing about eating here, although I also love the food and service.

Expect to pay a bit more than what you may have wanted to, but whatever.\n\nIt opened at 11, we got there at 11:20 and there was a 40-minute wait to sit outside!!  That sounds ridiculous, but my mom really wouldn't have it any other way, so we opted to wait.  Yes, they give you those shiny, shaky pagers so you can keep on gambling while you wait.  The decor was really pretty inside.  They have a Bloody Mary Bar!!!  Always a hit!  Of course by sitting outside, you've got prime views of the Bellagio fountains--so lunch and a show, always nice.\n\nI ordered the cheese plate.  Everytime I go to the Paris Hotel, I  must have me a cheese plate.  They've got the good stuff.  My plate came with brie, gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  It was accompanied by apple slices, grapes, and candied dates---the pairings were really good.  It also comes with a couple different breads to choose from.  The coffee was really good, too.  Always a plus.\n\nMy mom and sister split a fish and chips.  The fish was high class.  This ain't pub food.  It was lightly battered and fried---it looked like the entire fillet of halbut on the plate.  The chips are a bit different.  They're more like homemade potato crunchies than chips or fries.  That was a bit of a disappointment.  Other than that, can't complain."

Their bread is so good that I almost always fill on up on it by the time my food arrives.   I always get one of the hanger steaks, which are thin and tender.  I love their pomme frittes, which are similar to potato chips - thin and crispy.  I'm not sure how long the wait is bc I've always made sure to make reservations beforehand and never had to wait long for my table.   Definitely one of my favorites and affordable for someone on my sad salary."

The quiches and French toast plates are comparable to a 3-star menu.\n\nThe awesome view of the Bellagio water show from the outdoor patio kicks up a star. Of course the patio is great for people watching and sun-soaking.\n\nThe fifth star is from the \"bom digi bom di deng di deng digigi uu uuu\" Bloody Mary and the full veggie bar with delicious cured carrot sticks, crispy celery sticks, several different olives, a dozen of hot sauces, and best of all, beef jerky to stash in your Bloody Mary."

Others I was with had the scallops, which were raved about, and the escargot, which, while scorching hot, was also good.\n\nI tried my first escargot, just because, you never know what you might like.  Me- Not so much with the escargot.\n\nThis place does lose points on the environment.  It's very cramped and noisy.

My parents and other people that I know that have been here all rave about this place and I agree that it is warranted.\n\nUpdate:  I recommended to one of my co-workers (bona fide French!) and she fully approved of the place.  I steered her away from the buffet (boofet!).\n\nThe service sometimes leaves a bit to be desired.  I think that it is nice to sit outside when the weather is nice, but the service seems worse out there.  Inside and for dinner, the service seems better.\n\nAs someone who is tired of most of the casino restaurants, I can't say that I ever tire of this place.  I feel like a lot of the casinos have now taken for granted that after dropping a couple of g's at the tables, customers will not mind paying $45 for a buffet dinner that is a bit so-so... Wynn, I'm looking at you!\n\nSo if you REALLY want to eat somewhere on the Strip and you pass on my two places in my other reviews La Scala and Ichiza, then this place will deliver.  Also, you can make reservations here via OpenTable.com."

This is the best patio in Las Vegas. Is it the best French food in the world? No, but hey we are not in Paris anyway. So go, immediately and sit outside on the patio or have brunch on Sunday under the Atrium. Even if you can only stop in for a drink at the bar facing the strip you will be glad you made the effort of finding it. That is a Parisian experience for sure!! \nAnd in the more traditional event that you would like to eat dinner inside, that too is a romantic endeavor and one that will light your faces up by candlelight and be a beautiful dinner, I promise.\nIf you would like to sit outside it is the only thing that a reservation is not good for. You must come and sign up as they do not hold tables for anyone. However sometimes I will admit to making a reservation, and then if the wait isn't that long canceling it to sit outside. I know it may be wrong, but you have to know how to work the system to get a good table!!!!!"

I do reccommend the scallop appetizer. We saw a guy eating it at the bar and we had to order ourselves and it was very tasty.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? Just a couple minor technical errors.

My only quibble is that they've changed the style of their frites (again) and no longer have the shoestrings.  The new frites are so crisp they've not so good for dipping in the excess peppercorn sauce (half the fun).\n\nUnlike me, my wife ordered the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter, Rare.  Normally I like my steak medium rare (this this was really, really rare), but I tried a bite and it was hands-down the most tender piece of beef I can ever remember tasting.  Almost like perfect, seared ahi tuna.  Wow.  I also learned that you can order any of their steaks with any of the sauces.  So next time, I'll probably mix and match with the Filet.\n\nAll in all, one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  Excellent service and extensive wine list, too.  So why only 4 stars?

The staff invited us over early to check out the personalized menu, wine list, and to see the room.\n\nThanks to the advance planning, everything was smooth as butter. We had people coming and going all through the meal, and the servers didn't bat an eyelash. Thanks to our local office, we also got a lower minimum for the reserved room, which was a really nice touch, and even though we were inside we had a perfect view of the fountains. If you need to get a group meal going, this is a great place to do it. The private rooms accommodate a good number of guests, so chances are M-A-G will work.

Not to mention that a month ago or so, Christine T. sent me some suggestions on where to have our 2 year anniv dinner  (my db is her BIL),  some of the suggestions were French Bistro/Steakhouses (i.e. Clementine in SF, etc). Instead of celebrating our 2 yr in SF, my bf took me to Las Vegas. \n\nWe had 7PM reservations and we were seated immediately (It was really windy out and I decided to skip the patio seating). However, i wasn't very happy where we were seated. We were in the bar section in a little itsy bitsy corner table. I was very uncomfortable sitting there! I felt the table size was perfect for happy hour and appetizers, but not for a full dinner.  I complained a little bit to my db \"Are you sure you want to sit here?\"  - repeat that at least 3x.  He's not much of a complainer, so he said our table was fine.  I really couldn't understand why we were seated in this ITSY bitsy table,  when there were TONS of empty tables..even in the main dining room!  Did I mention my feet were all retarded cuz I couldn't sit straight? I had my feet over to the side, but I sucked it up.  Did I mention we were seated really close to the other table? I felt like we made the 2 gentlemen next to us a little uncomfortable. They probably thought the same thing \"Why did they seat this couple over here - there are tons of empty tables!\"\n\nWe ordered crab cakes to share - I just found it OK. I still prefer the crabcakes at Kincaids - may be I'm just used to them, but the portion was generous - I give them that.  \n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon with red wine sauce. I thought the sauce was delicious, but I was a little disappointed with my filet. I had ordered it medium rare, yet it came crunchy on the outside (Is it supposed to be like that?) At other steak places, my filet cuts like butter, this one I had to put some effort - again, is it supposed to be like that? The frites were yummalcious!! My bf couldn't stop saying how much he loved them. LOL   \n\nMy db ordered the steak with blue cheese and he did question it a few times, \"Is this over cooked? This doesn't look medium rare?\" Nonetheless, he ate it all. But, he's known to do that.  :)\n\nI decided to skip the wine since we've been up since 4am and we had a 1030P O show to watch. I didn't want to fall asleep. LOL.\n\nService was excellent and attentive, prices were reasonable for a steakhouse.  Not sure if I'll be running back soon - there are TONS of other restaurants to try out in Vegas."

This is a restaurant who's smart to WARM their butter. Honestly, why do some restaurants serve chilled, cold butter I do not understand, particularly those who serve cold butter with room temperature bread. Why? \n\nAnyway, back to the bread. \n\nStarving, I broke part of the baguette and smeared it with butter. Oh my God.. when you're hungry, eating a warm baguette that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, smeared with warm whipped butter is to die for. My mouth was so happy. The waitstaff put a small pat of minced garlic for the bread but I prefer sugar with my bread and butter. Haven't tried the bread-butter-sugar yet? Try it. It's very good. The sugar needs to be the refined, regular sugar though. Sweet n low, Splenda and all the fake sugar crap won't cut it.\n\nMm.. mmm. I ordered the appetizer (melted cheese with marinara sauce with garlic toasted bread) and salad (roasted pear with bleu cheese, walnuts and mix of greens).\n\nThe melted cheese was good, but I wished it was real cheese rather than cream cheese. The salad was superb. I was too full to order dessert even though I really wanted to try their banana foster. \n\nThis restaurant has one of the best location in Las Vegas.

We thought about sitting inside to escape the heat, but it was dark and depressing in the main dining room.\n\nWe started off with the mussels, which I liked after having one bite but with every bite I continued to take, they just kept getting worse and worse.  I had to quit after 3 bites because they became way to salty for my liking.  Also, there were about 3 unopened mussels, which is grounds for send-back...but I decided to go easy on them, until my entree that is.\n\nFor my main dish, I chose the seared salmon with a lemon butter sauce over orzo.  It was so bland and tasteless, I sent that bitch ass dish back.  The description on the menu made it sound so good,  and I was looking forward to that orzo, but it sucked in real life.  Sorry, but I have no pity for these huge casinos and I am expecting something not dissapointing when I'm dining at any one of them.  My bf liked his dish, though.  Maybe I chose the wrong thing, but I doubt I'll be giving them another chance to redeem themselves.\n\nThe view of the Bellagio fountains was entertaining, which was a plus.  Also, its right on the strip so people watching is fun also.  Thats about it as far as the positives go for me.  Oh, and the bread was really good.  Eh, I'll give 'em 2.5."

Brilliant! The waiter brings you a glass of vodka over ice. You do the rest - the bloody mary bar offers both tomato juice and bloody mary mix, every single hot sauce manufacutured in the world, worcestershire sauce, horseradish, celery, pickled asparagus, pickled onions, olives (you can also ask them to bring you blue cheese stuffed olives). It was the perfect way to end our Vegas weekend (well, winning back the money I lost in blackjack would have been perfect, but this was close enough). \n\nWe went on a Sunday, so not sure if the bloody mary bar is a Sunday brunch offering only, or whether it's there all the time. We sat outside, which offers a great view of Bellagio's fountain show, as well as excellent people watching (love what people can get away with (not) wearing in Vegas!)"

The wait for an outside table was a bit long considering it being a Monday night, but the ambiance made the food taste that much better. The filet mignon avec roquefort made me reconsider my latest vegetarian kick. The tarte tatin was not overwhelmingly sweet, ala Mrs smith apple pie special, yet it craved the dessert fix. A nearby couple gave us their remaining half drunken bottle of Deboeuf pinot Noir which was an added drunken surprise. If and when you come to Vegas and are not a proponent of low quality buffets or overpriced average hotel restaurant food, make your way to Gabi's for Vegas nouriture, frenchy style."

  "text" : "Whenever I'm in Las Vegas I always, always try to hit this place. This place is part bistro and part fancy schamncy restaurant. Now if you can get a table at the outside patio with a view of the Bellagio, that's pretty nice. That's where it feels like a fancy restaurant. But inside it's dimly lit, intimate, feels like a second dining room; and that's the bistro feeling.\n\nLook to spend about $30 to $50 a person. Expensive, yes. But SOOO worth it. If you're going to eat at a place like Mon Ami Gabi, you MUST eat everything, meaning every course...appetizers , entree and dessert. Plus some wine, and you are set. Now what I usually order every time I'm here is that I start with the house Merlot. Then for my appetizer, I go for the crab cakes, there are only 2 of them but they taste really good. Then my main course would be the Filet Mignon, medium well. Awesome and they serve it with pomme frites (French fries). Altogether I am in heaven, pure heaven. I usually variate what my dessert would be I think I usually get the strawberry crepe or the sorbet.\n\nNow getting a table here can be difficult. I usually call four hours before my dinner time, meaning I reserve a table. But usually before 7pm, you should be able to get a table. I think it gets crazy at sundown and everyone wants a table at night to watch the fountain show at Bellagio.\n\nFor me its the perfect place to eat. It doesn't try to hard to be the best or the prettiest. It just does what it should, serve great food, give great service, have a great atmosphere and cook a great steak!"

  "text" : "Ooh, la, la Mon Ami Gabi.  Merci, for a yummilicious dinner last night.  I made a last minute dinner reservation for 9:15, we showed up at 8:45 and they were able to squeeze us in.  I was hoping that I could make a reservation on the patio, but it's first-come first serve, and I was not willing to wait for 2 hours.  They seated us at an indoor table right next the window, so that we could still see the Bellagio fountains.  The server brought out some couscous, compliments of the chef, and freshly baked french bread and butter.  I feel a little guilty for having my boyfriend sitting across from me because I have to say that I was in love with the butter.  I ordered the house salad and my bf ordered the french onion soup.  I was really surprised by their large portions because I was expecting it to be smaller.  Then our entrees came, I got the steak au pouvre and the bf got the steak with onions.  My heart was all aflutter when I saw what was on my plate.  A large platter which was half covered with a thin steak and frites.  The steak was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium.  The frites were amazing, like strips of freshly cooked potato chips.  So like total gluttons, we inhaled our dinner.  As for dessert, we couldn't do it, we had eaten too much.  What made my bf very happy, which I think any water drinker would appreciate, was that his water glass was always filled without ever having to search for someone to refill it.  I can't wait to actually go back for dessert."

Go somewhere else.  Enjoy Mon Ami Gabi any other time!  \n\nThe waiter brought out a baguette with soft butter and yummy raspberry jam.  I usually do not eat jam but this was so good with the butter and soft, crusty bread.  I had a bloody mary, (or two!) it was good.  I heard raves about the bloody mary bar on here, but it is nothing special unless you are sitting right by it.  I would rather the waiter just bring out my drink.\n\nWe were warmed up by the tomato soup (yum) and french onion soup (yummier).  Also got the appetizer of baked tomato and cheese with toasts.  I thought it would be literally sliced tomato with melted sliced cheese on top.  It was actually a tomato puree with goat cheese.  Very good, but not expected, as we already had the tomato soup.\n\nThe quiche Lorraine was horrible.  There was an ingredient in there I couldn't stand, and my Mom disliked it, too.  That is not to say someone else would not like it, just not for me.  I got the chicken and brie sandwich, very good, as were the frites that came with it.  The best was the creamy chicken and mushroom crepe.  That also came with a salad with frisee and I think baby arugula with a tantalizing dressing... I wasn't sure what it was and forgot to ask our server.  Champagne vinegar, perhaps?\n\nI would definitely go back, though, and get the soup and the crepe.  I would also like to try the salad with pear & walnuts and the chocolate mousse."

Now, I could have had the crepes, which are great, but I was in the mood for frites, which is like a combination of a french fry and chips.  Basically, I think they cut the potato in to thin slice french fry shapes.  Then they do a quick fry to it.\n\nAnyway, I ordered the fish and chips.  Now, normally when you think fish and chips, you think of getting five or six fish pieces,  like chicken tender shapes and all.  But not this place.  They give you a whole fillet of fish that is wrapped with panko bread and fried.  The fillet was at least a foot long.

It basically melted in your mouth - so moist and juicy!  Simply amazing.  Unfortunately, I cannot speak about the dinner service as we only had lunch, but I would highly recommend having lunch and a couple beers and watching the fountains at Bellagio."

  "text" : "After a disappointing experience at Onda the night before, we were hoping Mon Ami Gabi would live up to our expectations and it certainly did! We had a great dinner and would definitely go back next time we are in Vegas. We went with a group of 13 on a Saturday night and had 6 pm reservations. Our server was really nice and joked around with us. Plus the fact that at the end of the night he was willing to do seperate checks and split it anyway we wanted was really cool of him.\n\nMy husband and I split the cheese plate for an appetizer...the St. Andre triple cream was by far my favorite of the three cheeses on the plate.  The Fleur de Marquis was OK and the blue cheese was probably my least favorite.  For dinner, I just had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was full of jumbo lump crabmeat and did not have much filler at all...in short, it was delicious.  The only part about the crab cake appetizer I did not like was the celery root remoulade.  I didn't care for the flavor and didn't feel that it complimented the crabcake well at all.  My husband had the seared sea scallops which he graciously let me try.  They were awesome...cooked perfectly as opposed to the disgusting ones I had at Onda the night before.  For dessert we had the chocolate mousse which was good and a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nMy only real negative is that if you have to use the restroom, you have to leave the restaurant and go around the corner back near the sports book to the bathroom there."

  "text" : "After driving 8+ hours to Las Vegas from Oakland I was, needless to say, exhausted and a little cranky. After checking into our hotel room we decided to check out the Paris casino. Then we got hungry. Then we waited about 20 minutes for a table on the patio. The hostesses were partially rude, but the rest of the night was so enjoyable I promptly forgot about their aloofness. The patio is awesome because you get a great view of the Bellagio fountain and, even more importantly, there are enough heat lamps!\n\nOur meals were delicious (flat iron steak and a sea bass special). The best thing about the sea bass, besides it tasting like heaven, was its substantial size. Normally fancy restaurants give you a fist sized serving, but not Mon Ami Gabi. My date's steak was nothing to scoff at, either. The wine our server suggested was very good and put me in a decidedly better mood than the one I sat down with. I would love to dine here again."

  "text" : "With all the overpriced french restaurants in the Paris Casino, Mon Ami Gabi is indeed a gem.  The food is thoroghly enjoyable, and I have not once felt like I've overpaid for anything.  I've been to this establishment three times, once for lunch and twice for dinner.  \n\nLet me talk about dinner. Lunch was great, but I don't remember anything about it :(  Dinner, my friends, is well worth it.  For one, I'm addicted to their \"c'est si bon\" martini (it's a bit overpriced...but it's absolutely delicious...what is it?  A watermelon martini, and it's fan-freaking-tastic!).  Now we get to why I adore dinner so much--it's that wondrous hot baguette that comes with a side of butter and slightly picked julienned carrots.  Oooh...I'm drooling. I could make a meal out of this and in fact, I did once.   Okay, I may be weird, but i'm obsessed with it.  \n\nI'm a sucker for their escargot.   How can I not be?  The sauce is scrumptious!  Butter, garlic, parsley AND I have this hot baguette!  W-O-W.  As for the entrees, I've had steak on both occassions--new york strip the first time and the ribeye special they had that night.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it very much...it's not going to be the same cute you get from 555 east or Mortons, but it's delicious nonetheless.  And the pomme frites? Spectacular!  The cut is just great.  \n\nI've also been equally happy with their desserts. I'm a sucker for creme brulee, and I'll even happily enjoy the most mediocre of creme brulees.  I would have to say that my favorite desserts are the crepes and the tarte tartin (rustic apple tart) a la mode. Divine!  I have a sweet tooth.  \n\nAs far as customer service goes, I have absolutely complaints--with the exception of feeling a bit embarassed by the incredulous looks I get from devouring a loaf of bread and carrots."

  "text" : "After waking up at noon and missing brunch buffet, we decided to go to this quaint little French cafe inside Paris. We had a nice dinner at Picasso that night so we didn't want to be too full, so we got there around 1, but the service was SO slow and we didn't get our food and finish eating until almost 3 PM. I think we finally got out of the place around 3:30 and by then, we had to go back to our hotel to change and stuff. I think we waited literally 20 minutes for our check because the waiter loves to chat it up with all the other tables. \n\nThe actual food was decent. I think I had the Gruyere cheese, bacon and, onion burger, which was pretty good. The \"frites\" (fries) were kind of weird because they were like regular fries but squashed flat and then refried. A little too much. Also tried some chicken B.L.T and steak sandwich with caramelized onions, which were decent. I think the best  thing I tried was the Steak Bordelaise, which was really juicy and tender. Maybe we should have went for weekend brunch, which might have been better with some breakfast foods. Regardless, service needs to speed up a bit. It was somewhat French, but I don't think they were trying to imitate the carefree attitude of dining and taking your time in France."

I have to say I was quite pleased, there were a few snags but overall it was a good experience. \n\nThe food was fantastic.  The escargot was great, very garlicky but I love garlic so I was fine with it!  My filet was cooked to medium rare perfection and was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time.  (Much better than the steak I had at N9NE) The wine we selected was fantastic, so good we ordered a second bottle.  The bananas fosters crepe was huge and my husband and I could not finish it.....it was that big! \n\nOverall I think it's a great dining experience on the strip if you want a good meal for your money.

While our server was attentive however, my husband received his steak au poivre, not what he ordered, but still great all the same."

  "text" : "We sought out a lunch place for after our Vegas arrival so we thought the view and food of Mon Ami Gabi would be a nice way to start the weekend. For the most part it was. We were told that if we wanted to get started now we could sit we could sit inside or wait 30 mins and sit outside. We were hungry so screw it we'll sit inside...we walked..and walked...and walked and found ourselves outside much to our surprise! So we were in the covered patio. Perfect - just barely under the awning, avoiding the scorching Sun. \n\nThis is definitely a place to be seen...especially if your penchant for attention-whoredom is working on whatever day you're there.\n\nThe service here is pretty good - despite forgetting a beer that got hidden behind several other drinks, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the wine selections and even let me taste before deciding. I think that deserves some merit. Their wine of the week was a Layercake Cotes-du-Rhone. Apparently the wine maker came from Barossa valley in Australia but started a vineyard in France. Very good with the food.\n\nOn to the food! Started with the butter lettuce salad with citrus vinaigrette. There is something that feels sophisticated about cutting your lettuce up rather than just constantly stabbing at veggies. My girl thought the dressing was too oily. I liked it and thought it was pretty good but nothing that would blow you away. It was a bit too warm for soup but the french onion soup looked as good as the Yelp reviews made it sound from looking at what others were ordering. For our main courses we shared sandwiches - they had a special which was a turkey sandwich with brie and orange marmalade. Sounded great so we got that. Everything was pretty good except the turkey. I thought it was a bit of a step up from butterball. It wasn't bad, but I thought they should put a bit more effort into that turkey.\n\nThe Croque Monsieur here is AMAZING. Holy crap - I've had these several times before...maybe at 4-5 different restaurants but this was far and away the best. The cheese gratinee on top was great - the ham was very flavorful. If you're in the mood for a sandwich you need to try this sandwich. They'll do it \"Madame\" style if you prefer as well.\n\nGreat lunch spot - comparing it to something more local to me, like left bank, I'd say this appears to have much of the same appeal - (what is supposed) standard french fare with the to-be-expected American concessions. Definitely a relaxing, memorable experience."

  "text" : "Until last night I had only been to Mon Ami Gabi for business lunches.  We'd sit on the patio overlooking the strip and I'd order good food, but be green with envy of all the people who were there just for the pleasure of it.  I adore my clients and enjoy their company very much, but lets face it, its not the same as a cozy, romatic dinner for two.\n\nI didn't get the romance last night, but did have dinner on the patio with another client, who I also consider a friend.  We got there around 6:30 and were seated on the patio after just a few minutes wait.  We apparently arrived just in time because it was packed.  Like other yelpers have mentioned, there's great people watching because you are literally sitting right above the strip.......and having the water fountains at Bellagio across the street adds to the ambience and uniqueness of being in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately we only got to see one show because the wind interferred.   But the wind (I'd call it more of a breeze) felt great and the weather was perfect.  We ordered a bottle of Sancerre, which always makes me happy, and it was the perfect wine to enjoy underneath the setting sun (hmmmmm, this does sound kind of romantic, doesn't it?).  For an appetizer, we ordered the steamed artichoke, which was very good with a lemon mayo for dipping and for dinner I had the scallops atop a cauliflower mash and spinach.  My friend had the skate, which was perfect too.  We also ordered a side of roasted beets, which is where the one slip up happened with us.  Our server forgot to bring it until we were pretty much through with dinner, so they didn't charge us for it.....and it was yummy. \n\nFinding a fabulous meal in Las Vegas is very easy.  Finding one that doesn't cost over $100 per person is not.  Our total dinner came out to around $150 including the wine and the tip.  What adds to this being such a great value is that it is one of the only places (that I know of) where you can sit outside right on Las Vegas Boulevard.  If you are in Las Vegas for vacation, then this will certainly enhance that feeling of being in the center of things.  There's Trader Vic's next door, but its a totally different vibe....more of a lounge/bar than a restaurant patio."

I wish you could just pay to go there and eat fresh baguette w/ butter and the carrot stuff.\n\nTook the BF here for an anniversary dinner, and while the service and food were both excellent, I honestly wish the whole experience had taken longer. We definitely weren't rushed or anything, but all our courses came out at lightning speed, and considering how fast we devoured all the frenchy goodness, we were only there for an hour or so. \n\nAfter being promptly seated for our dinner reservation, we started with the french onion soup. I'm not that much of a soup guy, but how can you eat at a French restaurant without ordering multiple courses, and ensuring that the majority include an alarming amount of cheese, butter, or other source of saturated fat?? There must have been about 5 lbs. of gruyere on that bad boy, but wow, was it delish. Next courses: trout grenoblaise (sp?) and filet mignon. The trout was the perfect portion, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy, although I didn't care too much for the accompanying potatoes. BF's filet was decent, but the horseradish sauce on top really made it melt in your mouth. Up next: creme brulee. I don't think I've had enough creme brulee to discern the quality of this particular one, but BF said it was really good.\n\nOverall, a great place if you want to eat on the Strip while not going broke that offers great, but not amazing, fare. I really wish we had sat on the patio bc it's right across from the Bellagio fountains. If you go, take time to ENJOY your food and don't inhale it like voracious pigs. And don't fill up on the carrot slaw stuff, even though it's hard!"

I was starving and couldn't wait, so  after trying nearly ever where in the Bellagio, I gave up and headed for the Strip.  I noticed a few people braving the 106 degree weather on the patio at Mon Ami and figured their must be a reason. \n\nThe hostess was a little self involved, and initially tried to seat us outside, even though we requested an inside table. We compromised and settled for a table in the shade . \n\nI started with the Gazpacho, and my friend ordered the French Onion Soup. Both were tasty. The French Onion featured a  mountain of cheese, and the gazpacho was refreshing, with just a hint of basil. \n\nI went with the Bacon Wrapped pork tenderloin for dinner. What could be better than pork wrapped in pork? Seriously. It was good, if a little overdone for my taste. However, I did enjoy the potato puree and the Cherry Port sauce that accompianed it. My friend went with a Market tomato salad and the Crab Cake and Gribiche Sauce.  The tomatoes were fresh and delicious and the Crab Cake was excellent. \n\nI ordered a glass of the LaRouche Pinot Noir.  I think it suffered from setting on the rolling wine cart in the 106 degree heat.  \n\nDessert was Bananas Foster and Creme Brulee. Both were delicious,  as was the coffee. \n\nMon Ami is very reasonably priced for a restaurant on the Strip, and the food is good. I probably would have gone with three starts though if not for the excellent service provided by our amazingly hot waiter Matthew. Seriously. I am rarely ever speechless, but this one rendered me mute."

I keep coming back, despite the mediocre food, partially due to the relaxing environment this restaurant places you in.\n\nThe allure of this restaurant is not just it's casual bistro-like food, but the view. The view is what sells people to come here. Nobody ever really sits far within the restaurant, everyone sits in the patio area. Bellagio fountain, front row seat, with good food and champagne in front of you. The life of a winner (or the consolation prize of the big loser - in my case).\n\nCame here for a nice Sunday brunch, and ordered relatively smaller dishes, partially since I was so weighed down with guilt of how much money I had lost the night before.\n\nGot myself a hearty French onion soup, and salmon rillettes.\n\nFrench onion soup was hearty, but salty. A huge amount of cheese (gruyere possibly, was not really paying too much attention). Good flavoring, solid dish.\n\nSalmon rillettes I may not get again. It was decent, but not transcendent. The cornichons with the salmon rillettes were well pickled, but something was just lacking with the rillettes. Not sure what.\n\nIf anything, the best part are the fresh french baguettes that come out before hand with any dish. Warm warm baguettes, with raspberry jam, and good butter. Excellent stuff.\n\nOrdered a bottle of Perrier-Jouet Champagne Brut MV. Don't really scoff at this bottle, even though it is the cheapest one on their list. It's well worth the money, and reasonably priced (68$, vs ~40$ at BevMo, and more for others). Freaking awesome champagne - rated pretty highly as well. A definite must get, and makes you feel like an absolute high roller, even though you're rolling in the mud with your huge losses.\n\n4 stars - Inconsistent food, but excellent view and service, in addition to fresh baguettes, make up a great experience. You can just sit down, look towards the fountains, and sigh in relaxation."

Talk about overpriced and underwhelming! It wasn't my choice.\n\nVerdict: Vive la Strip restaurant that actually is reasonable and serves good food for less than $100/person."

It was cheesey, full flavored and amazing. I ordered the Steak Au Poivre avec Frites which was good, not as great as the soup but definitely still yummy. However the service was lacking. They took my soup away before I was done with it and without asking. I never received a steak knife even though I asked 3 times for one and my diet coke was never refilled which was also requested several times. Quel dommage!"

  "text" : "There are a few things I must do each time I go to Vegas, and one of them is eat steak.  Bizarre, perhaps, but a lifelong tradition I have no interest in stopping any time soon.\n\nOn my most recent trip, my friend and I were discussing which wonderful, carnivorous eatery to frequent.  I mentioned a couple of my long-time favorites, and she countered with Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nHer selling point was excellent steak on a budget.  Fair enough, I'm always up for trying something new.  \n\nWe had a reservation and were seated promptly.  They let us choose between indoor or outdoor seating.  It was 10 million degrees outside (no exaggeration!) so we opted for inside.  The setting was quaint, very bistro-in-the-real-paris-with-much-higher-ceilings.  Our waiter was *awesome*.  He excelled at flirting 101, but not in an annoying way.\n\nWe both ordered the steak frites.  The beef was good, the sauce (you get to choose one) was disappointing (I had the bordelaise) and I was glad I ordered it on the side.  My friend loved her mushroom sauce.  The fries were amazing.  Possibly the best ever.\n\nOther selling points: I wasn't in a wine mood, as I had already had a couple of drinks elsewhere before dinner, and our waiter poured me a glass on the house.  The carrot tapenade and baguette were fabulous.  There were nickel slots outside the front door.  Okay, nix the last one.\n\nTo sum it up, good steak, good price, not my favorite in Vegas... but Daniel is now my favorite waiter in all of Nevada.\n\nFinally, I wish I could comment on dessert, but I was determined to have my Vegas cheesecake at Carnegie Deli after Crique de Soleil.  So no dessert was had."

Everyone decided they aren't in the mood for steak so I wasn't about to go drop that much money for steaks that night. \n\nWe decided to go to Mon Ami. What a great decision. My sister and I had eaten here a year before and remember it being just good. \nLike a fine wine, this place aged with grace. \n\nThe Service- Impeccable. Thank you to our server Marlin, who was gracious, patient, courteous and seriously, one of the best waiters ever. He made the profession look good people. Everything was on time and with a smile. \n\nThe Appetizers- Grilled Artichoke and Escargot. AMAZING. Perfect.\n\nDinners- 3 different cuts of steak with delicious sides. One of the steaks was the special 24 oz Rib Eye- WOW.  Mule Frites (Mussels and French Fries) that reminded me of Paris. (Except they use the large, CA mussels). The French fries here are also flat stringy fries. But hey, a potato is a potato and it was fried just how I like it, CRISPY! :)\n\nWine list is good too. Have Bordeaux. (Had one glass, and 2 beers)\n\nDessert- Yes we had dessert too, were in Vegas after all. We had the chocolate mouse and the crème Brule with coffee. YUM Yum YUm all around. \n\nWe were so full in the best way possible. And to top this all off, the bill for 4 people, for all this deliciousness and service...$189.00. \nWHAT? I had to look twice. I couldn't believe it!!!! I was happy.\n\nThe atmosphere was also so romantic, friendly and it's a huge place. PLUS they also have a huge patio area that faces the Bellagio fountains. FORGET trashy/snobby Olives and come to Mon Ami Gabi!!!\nI will absolutely make this restaurant a regular on my list when I go to Vegas."

Anyone who ever says they hate Vegas has obviously never spent an afternoon at this delightful French bistro.  What's not to love about Vegas sunshine, great company, fine wine, fantastic food, Andrea Bocelli singing \"Time to Say Goodbye\" as the fountains at the Bellagio seem to perform just for you.  I've now been three times -- it's a Vegas must -- and each time the food, service and atmosphere have yet to disappoint. While the Israeli quartet at the next table who chain smoked added a seemingly French touch, one should keep in mind that Las Vegas's no smoking ordinance only applies indoors.  That makes for a tough choice.  But the food is so good -- from the bread to the dessert  -- I'd sit just about anywhere to enjoy it. And you get a lot -- Mon Ami Gabi may be French food but it is not \"nouvelle cuisine\" of small portions and high prices, in fact the prices are quite reasonable.   I wish they were open later as I'd go three times  in one day if I could!"

The decor was nice...nothing extravagant, but nice nonetheless.  I ordered the thyme-seared salmon with orzo, spinach, and lemon butter for $18.95.  My wife had the roast chicken & frites (grandmere style) with mushrooms, bacon & pearl onions for $18.95 as well. Both dinners were very good.  I would give mine an \"outstanding\" rating though.

We also both ordered steak frites which we both enjoyed. And the fries, the best we've had by far. So thin and crispy. We had tarte tatin for dessert, it was delicious but a little too sweet and by that time we hardly had room in our tummies anyway. Their mojito was also pretty good, strong and very minty.

From the hostess to the bus boy to our waiter, everyone was friendly and accomodating. The food, however, gets two stars. This puts me in the position to round up or down, at a 3.5 average. Well folks, I just have to round down because dinner was $150 and not worth it. \n\nTo start, we shared the baked shrimp. These were tasty, but to be honest you'd find something just as good at a mid range chain. For our entrees I had the filet, and my gorlfriend had the pork tenderloin medallions wrapped in bacon. The medallions were fantastic. Very tender, very flavorful, and accompanied by creamy but tato-rich mashed potatoes. That meal was worth it price, HOWEVER, my filet....oh my filet. Stringy, chewey, and bland are the first 3 adjectives that come to mind. I told the waiter that it was disappointing, to which he offered to take it off our bill. Very nice of him, but I would not necessitate that. He tried to explain that a filet cut was different, but  really, really it was Denny's quality, but with Denny's you have low expectations! This place poses as fine dining...and honestly the quality is lacking.  The medallions were the only stand out item.\n\nI live in San Francisco, where there are a lot of inexpensive options with a lot more value. Honestly, save yourself a buck. If you want better food for a synonymous price go to the Wolfgang Puck cafe at the MGM. If you want to spend $150 do the tasting menu at the Michael Minna restaurant down the way in the MGM. These both provide better food for your buck. \n\nI do want to reiterate, though , that the service here was great, despite the sub par cuisine."

  "text" : "After searching Yelp for weeks and posting a thread asking for anniversary dinner suggestions on the Strip (thanks, helpful Vegas Yelpers!!), my husband and I settled on Mon Ami Gabi.  I am SO glad we did.\n\nHad an 8:00pm reservation and when we got there we were greeted by the friendly hostess and taken right to our table.  We were seated in the really cute inside/outside patio area, which I would say definitely provides the best of both worlds.  You're seated in an open-air style setting, but still have a roof over your head and, best of all, air conditioning...which is crucial when you're dressed up all cute but are dying in the Vegas heat.  ; )  AND....you still have a view from your table of the beautiful Bellagio water show across the street.  PERFECT.  The only small thing I wished was different was that only one of us could face the street/show at our little two-seater table...would have been ideal to sit side by side and both enjoy the view.  : )\n\nOur waitress came to greet us and had lots of wonderful suggestions to share.  I ended up ordering the Thyme-Seared Salmon with Orzo Pasta & Lemon Butter sauce and my hubby ordered the Filet Mignon with Frites (thinly sliced fried potatoes...tasted to me like a cross between a french fry and potato chip).  The salmon was huge and the flavor of the sauce was outstanding....my husband also thoroughly enjoyed his filet.  They were both TO-DIE-FOR.....SOOO good.\n\nWhen it came time for dessert our waitress again made amazing recommendations...I got the Crème Brulee and my husband took her suggestion and tried the off-menu dessert special, which was a bread pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  The Crème Brulee was really good, but I'd say the bread pudding was the winner....OMG.  I almost wanted to steal that from him.  ; )  She also highly recommended the Flourless Chocolate Cake, which I LOVE.  I wasn't in the mood for it that night, so will definitely try it on our next trip.  \n\nOur waitress was incredible....SO attentive and warm....making sure to take her time with us and check on us frequently....wishing us a Happy Anniversary at the beginning and end of our meal and even taking a keepsake picture of us with our camera.  She definitely made the experience a memorable one.\n\nIf you are looking for a great place to spend a special occasion in Vegas without breaking the bank, I'd say this is definitely it.  Our check came out to only around $120 (including tip) for two entrees, two desserts, and two alcoholic drinks.  Not bad at all considering other places I researched on the Strip....\n\nOverall, I absolutely LOVED Mon Ami Gabi.  From the ambiance, to the food, to the view, the service....the entire experience was top notch!"

I definitely suggest eating outside, because you can enjoy the weather at this time.  Although it was about 104 degrees while we were visiting, it started to cool down at this time, and there's fans overhead to give you some breeze.  At 8pm the Bellagio fountain shows start and will replay every 15 minutes, which is perfect because then you can enjoy the music AND watch the show.  Lastly, you can people watch from your table, which is always very interesting : )\n\nThe food was okay--we had the steak w/ butter sauce and the steak w/carmelized onions.  Both of the steaks were good, but not very memorable.  The escargot was covered in a pesto sauce and was okay.  The onion soup was so-so: it wasn't piping hot, and there was about an inch-thick layer of cheese.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert: mixed berries with a buttery crumb topping and vanilla ice cream."

Someone screwed up there.  But the fish was a worthy substitute.  Served with fingerling potatoes on a bed of deliciously flavored frisee.  My husband had the butternut squash with apple bisque.  It was fine.  Almost as good as an identical one I make at home.  He had a filet with merlot sauce.  Ordered medium rare, as it was served, yet, surprisingly dry.

Although we made reservations it took them 10-15 min to set up our table and the front hostess has a bit of a snooty attitude towards us. We were seated by the outdoor balcony facing the Bellagio, which had a nice view. The complimentary french bread was very good, it was crunchy and warm. We also had a small complimentary dish from the chef, some sort of shaved carrots with lemon juice and pepper. It was refreshing and has a bit of a ting to it. \n\nI started off with the Soup du jour, which was butternut squash/apple soup.  It was creamy and had a very distinct butternut squash flavor. For entree, since it was a \"french steakhouse,\" I ordered the Steak Roquefort with blue cheese sauce, It was the blue cheese sauce that caught my attention. The steak was a thin 1/4\" thick flank steak, I assumed, with a wad of blue cheese sauce and some frites. I was a bit disappointed in the steak as it was a bit chewy and the exterior was grainy. The cheese sauce was good but I really expect the steak itself to be way better. In addition I ordered a side of ratatouille. My friends ordered the New York strip steak, which I was told was good, maybe I just didn't ordered the right item. Finally for dessert I ordered the sorbet, to be honest I really don't know what flavor it was, because when I ordered the waitress said it was blood orange, but it was nothing like blood orange, maybe I just heard it wrong. However, the sorbet was good and refreshing as you can imagine in the hot weather. \n\nOverall, service was average, food was not as good as I expected, but the view was magnificent. I give 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the view, that's 3.5 stars, but I will have to dock 0.5 stars for the snooty hostess."

  "text" : "Based on oour extensive prior extremely positive experiences, my wife and I, plus three other couples, made sure to visit MAG for a nice dinner on our final night in Vegas earlier this week.  We could have been seated immediately inside, but it was a beautiful November night and we opted to wait--heck, rolling some dice, plus free table drinks for 40 minutes, no problem.\n\nWe finally get seated and they squeeze us into a four-top.  That's OK, we like each other and expected to be squeezed.  If you're new, be warned that they put about 250 diners in a space that any other restaurant would put 100.  For us, not a great big deal because of the anticipation of excellent food and the great view of the strip and the Bellagio water shows.\n\nAnd the aniticipation grew and grew until about an hour after ordering we finally got our meals.  The waitress explained that she had waited to talk to the chef about an allergy issue one of us had before putting any of the orders in.  I'm sorry, but when you are sitting at an uncomfortable table and will end up paying about $150/person, you shouldn't have to wait an hour to get served.\n\nWhen the entrees finally got there, they were all very excellent, but those who bided their ample time by eating bread and appetizers could not finish their entrees.  About the only bad entree choice anyone mentioned was the duck confit, which seemed to have about 1 ounce of meat on a bone, and not great flavor.\n\nThe onion soup appetizer was horribly cheesy and not as good as on prior visits.  But the filets and steaks, with fantastic Bernaise sauce, are definitely to die for, and it will likely contribute to my demise. \n\nSo after taking about 30 minutes to get through the meal (things go slower when you have to wait for the person next to you to finish using their knife before you do so you don't cut each other open), we then proceeded to wait and wait another 30 minutes to get the check.  It's not like we wanted to further enjoy the nice night--by now it was after 10:00 and the temperature had dropped about 20 degrees in the past hour.  \n\nWe were so anxious to leave, no one dared venture into the desserts.\n\nAnd the worst part was, when we make it back to the craps table, we had just missed a 45 minute roll.  Would have paid for our entire visit, and then some, had we not had to wait for the waitress all night.\n\nOh well, life is all about memories, and we'll still have memories of some great meals here.  Probably won't come back, except perhaps for lunch and the best boulliabaise you could ever get.\n\nI really feel bad about giving three stars.  Lat week I would have given 5 plus.  It's true what they say that one bad experience overshadows hundreds of good ones.  C'est le vie."

My friends and I went there for brunch during our weekend in Vegas and were completely satisfied with everything.\n\nWhat initially peaked our interest was the bloody mary bar.  Two of my friends partook and went and created their own bloody maries.  When you arrive, they provide baguettes in the paper bags you would receive if you bought them at a boulangerie in France.  \n\nI had a croque monsieur with fries and a mimosa.  The sandwich was good and so was the mimosa.  The fries were unique.  They were cut very thin.  My friends ordered other sandwiches and salads and everyone was very happy with their meal.  \n\nWe sat outside b/c it was a beautiful, sunny afternoon.  The staff let us linger at the table for two hours as we ate, drank and laughed.  Since Paris is across the street from the Bellagio, we were able to witness the musical fountain shows every 1/2 an hour.  It made us laugh to watch the fountains soar into the sky to the voice of Celine Dion.  \n\nGreat food, friendly staff, good drinks.  Would return when in the mood for French food."

The service was a bit obsequious, but she was lovely, friendly, and warm.\n\nThis is a casual eatery we walked into in Paris and had no reservations.  It was a Saturday night, and we were sat by a lovely, romantic window within seconds.\n\nThe atmosphere was incredible.... across from the Bellagio Water Show, and next to a window in a romantically lit restaurant that had a wonderful aesthetic... tiled floors (slippery in heels), lovely deep wooden grain finish on the classic bar.  It was as close to a dimly lit French bistro as you might find out of France.\n\nThe food was awesome.... \n\nThe oysters had one of the best mignonette's I have ever had.  For Las Vegas, oyster country (sarcasm button on), they were fresh and shucked decently.  Luckily, nothing like Andy K.\n\nThe Endive and Blue Cheese salad with watercress and roasted pear was sublime.  The French Onion soup was great.  Again, I don't like it sweeter than smoky or \"zesty\"... but it was great.\n\nThe Salade Maison was very good, but the presentation of the goat cheese and croutons being the piece of toast with cheese spread ontop of it was confusing... in that Lauren ate that without realizing that was the \"goat cheese & croutons\" inherent to the salad.\n\nThe French Martini was great (grey goose with pineapple, champagne, and chambord....)\n\nThe French 75 was perfect.  I subbed beefeater for the sapphire, and it was just awesome.  AWESOME!\n\nBut being on the strip, even a casual, non reservation type of meal... the bill came to $140 or something.  1 app, 2 salads, 4 cocktails, one soup.... $140.\n\nI know it is demanding to ask Vegas to be cheap, but to sit for a couple apps and salads and see a bill like that is just... disheartening.\n\nSo... go to Vegas with money.  PLEASE PLEASE shove cost out of your head prior to sitting down ANYWHERE.\n\nBecause Vegas is pricey.  Check out my Las Vegas as to why.... but it isn't just expensive.  I work in fine dining and high end hotels, and the price point is at least 20%-35% over a normal meal.  \n\nAs long as you recognize that, even a casual, spur of the moment meal can be magical, romantic, delicious, and stunning.\n\nI would go back here in a second, with the awareness I wish I had previously had.  I think having not been to vegas much, it is something I simply need to plan for across the board."

Plus, it was Dec. 18th, which I guess is historically one of the slowest times in Vegas.  Anyway, our server went ahead and gave some recommendations for entrees and man, am I glad I went with his suggestions!  My husband and I both ordered the filet with Merlot butter reduction.  I am not even joking, this is most likely the best meal I have ever had in my life.  The filet was PERFECT.  Super tender, moist, and absolutely delicious when coupled with the merlot sauce!  The super thin fries are really interesting.  We also shared a plate of garlic spinach (which, btw, was definitely big enough for 2 to share) which was quite tasty.  For dessert, we got the chocolate mousse which was also excellent!  The service was great.  Our server offered for us to have a taste of the wine we were considering buying a bottle of....and that was indeed a great idea since we liked it a lot and bought the bottle.  \n\nAmbiance is very nice and you can't beat an evening view of the Bellagio fountains!  We sat inside right by the window.  We couldn't hear the music when the fountain show was on, but oh well.  That's a very minor drawback.  \n\nOverall, it was absolutely fabulous.

Perhaps it was Christmas and the chef wasn't around or there was no delivery of fresh steak on Christmas day or whatever, but the steaks were the worst we've ever had at a restaurant that claimed to be a steakhouse of any sort.        \n\nWe had the following: \n\n- French onion soup - standard, decent, not spectacular\n- Frisee & bacon salad - tasty\n- Steak au poivre\n- Steak roquefort\n- Filet mignon with merlot butter  and red wine reduction\n\nI think the problem is with quality of the steaks, the sauces were fine, but my mom's steak roquefort had the texture of cotton, my sister's steak au poivre had the texture of cotton with lots of veins and fat lumps, my filet mignon had a stringy texture like a inferior cut of meat and was not at all firm.  It was so bad that we left much of the entree untouched and left right after the main course, we didn't even have dessert on Christmas!!  This was a very disappointing meal and ruined our Christmas.  \n\nOn the other hand, the service was fine and the  prices were definitely cheaper than traditional steakhouses, $31 for the filet and $23 for the regular steaks, but the quality is not anywhere near Ruth Chris, Morton or Fleming's."

So they took us out of the line and then told us that it would be a 30 minute wait for the patio and to wait \"over here to the side\". But we were almost in the front of the line before, and we weren't informed abou the wait for the patio before making our decision! So we had to hound them to put us back in our spot in line for an inside table--and they weren't too gracious about it.\n\nOur server was nice, and when he knocked one of our mimosas over (which was less than half full,) he gave us 2 more for free. The food fell flat.  The warm bread was nice and the mimosas were good, but our croque-monsieurs, which we thought would be a good hangover dish, were dry and flavorless.

For anyone that was out there that week knows it was cold and we still sat out on the patio. They had a lot of heaters that made it a very pleasant experience still to be outside. First off the view from the patio is great and for me is the reason you come here you have a great but not uninstructed view of the Bellagio fountains and great to people watch. Very good date place to impress your special someone. Second, the waiter and everyone working at Mon Ami Gabi was great. The waiter noticed my Atlanta Falcons hat that I had taken off and put on the chair and started talking that he was from Atlanta and that he had family in Kennesaw, GA. Impressed that he noticed this and struck up a conversation that was personal to the people at his table. They had a great selection of food and prices were not bad compared to other locations I've been to and seen in Las Vegas. I'm by no means an expert on french food and this was the first time I've tried it. My family makes quiche a lot and I hate it. But, figured I would try it here and I have to say I loved it. So much I've got all the ingredients to try and make at home. Food was great for myself and my friend. We ordered the Chicken & Gruyere Crepe, Classic quiche Lorraine, and a diet Pepsi and the total without tip was 30.06. Not too bad in Vegas standards. I did not try any wine but they had a great wine selection from what I looked at. I really liked this place and will keep this on my list to go back as I continue to plan on going to Vegas every year. This place gets Big thumbs up from me. The atmosphere inside and out of the restaurant was great, food was great, and service was awesome. A great Christmas eve lunch I'll never forget. I suggest it to anyone thinking about this place.\n__________________"

If you manage to score a seat outside you'll get a great view of not only the human traffic on the strip but of the fountain show across the street at the Bellagio.  \n\nI always have the same meal only varying on which type of Steak Frites: French Onion Soup, Steak Frites and Crème Brûlée.   The Steak Frites is a treat for me because it gives me a break from the usual steakhouse fare of filets, ribeyes and strips (although they serve those as well).   It's simple to make and there's nothing better to eat.  It's a thin, lean cut with less marbling and best cooked rare to medium rare.   My favorites are the Steak Clasique, Steak Roquefort or Steak Bearnaise.  You'll also find many other French staples such as baguettes and escargot."

It's perfectly located in the Paris hotel.\n\nFor chain french food, this place is very good.  We went for brunch on a Sunday and enjoyed the crepes.  The smoked salmon and the cheese plate were also great appetizers.  \n\nIf the weather permits, request to sit outside on the patio as it gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very french, even if the crowd isn't.\n\nThe one odd thing was that they ran out of iced tea during our meal, but they made good on it by subtracting the teas from our bill.\n\nProps to the Paris hotel for targeting the gay market.  The BF and I were pleased to be seated next to four family boys during our lunch.  \n\nAll in all, brunch at Mon Ami Gabi is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas."

  "text" : "Do you like a little drama with your soup? Do you want a burger that could make you cry? What about a bloody mary that can be a meal unto itself? Throw in a little bit of a view and you have Mon Ami Gabi! \n\nSure I wanted to sit outside on the patio, under the perfect Las Vegas sun and pretend I was in Paris, but so did everyone else. Second best option sit inside up against the glass windows and enjoy the sun pouring in onto your face. Actually option two was better because the deuce was all ours. We weren't bumping into other tables. \n\nWhat better way to start a Sunday morning brunch than with a bloody mary. Not just any ole bloody mary but the \"make it yourself\" bloody mary. Bring me half a glass of vodka (yes that is correct) and walk over to the bloody mary fix-it bar to create your little \"mary masterpiece\". So many different mixes and garnishes. I went with the crisp strips of bacon, pepperoni stick, mandatory celery stick and one caper berry. (I actually went really tacky and piled the bacon in like some of the patrons at the Bellagio buffet do with their plates of food.) Once back at my table I deconstructed the bloody mary and enjoyed each component unto itself. \n\nI really didn't need food after this ordeal but I went ahead anyway. The soup of the day was a cream of wild mushroom soup garnished with chanterelle mushrooms and celery root puree. The shallow bowl comes to the table with the garnish smack in the middle and then the show begins. From behind her back the actress (waitress) pulls a large cast iron kettle billowing with steam. From high above she tilts it aiming into my bowl below, pouring the most velvety looking soup ever. Not a drop was splattered and just the right amount surround the garnish perfectly. I have one thing to say: D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S What would have just rounded it out would have been a drizzle of truffle oil. Orgasm! \n\nAnd at last the main course. A perfectly cooked, med rare burger with Gruyere and yes more bacon. All setting nicely on a brioche bun with a side of string fries and cornichorn. \n\nOINK! You Betcha!"

We were late for our reservations but no problem - we were still seated right away. \n\nLoved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Dimly lit with dark decor. Totally reminded me of being in a French bistro (and yes, I have been in a real French bistro in France). \n\nStarted off with the onion soup au gratin which was tasty and ooey gooey cheesy. I liked how they had slices of baguette with the crust still on which gave it great texture and flavor. I have to admit though that it was a tad salty for my liking but I finished it anyway. \n\nFor our entree, I got the filet with merlot butter and red wine reduction and the fiance got the trout Grenobloise. I got my filet cooked medium and when I got it, it was perfectly cooked. Juicy and fork tender. It literally melted in my mouth. I didn't get to try my fiance's trout however it was a rather large portion and he was very content with his rich and savory dish. \n\nI also have to a say that service was superb. They were quite attentive with our drinks with always refilling our glasses when the were getting empty. Also our soup came out in no time and our entrees were also presented to us before we finished our soup. Our waiter was gracious enough to take our entrees back to the kitchen to say warm until we finished our soup. \n\nDining at Mon Ami Gabi was a fantastic experience. Loved every minute and bite that I had. I surely will eat here again on my next trip!"

  "text" : "Not a bad choice I made for dinner, if I do say so myself.  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio,  inside the Paris casino, it's about as European as you can get in Vegas.  It's dark, romantic, and seductive, the waitstaff (or at least our waiter) has excellent manners, and the busboys refill your water regularly, and the prices are very reasonable for the level of service and quality.  An excellent, well-organized, French-style restaurant.  They made a little boo-boo on my girlfriend's order, but from my standpoint it was just about perfect.  Oh, and Betty H. just reminded me of how they put a mini baguette right on the table in the bag - a classy touch, and fresh, tasty bread to boot, with your choice of whipped butter or whipped carrots.  I chose . . . both.\n\nYou might think that a vegetarian foodie (some of you don't understand that there is such a thing, but I'll let you catch up) wouldn't be able to find anything at a French restaurant, but au contraire, mon frere - they have a vegetarian sampler that is anything but an afterthought.  Garlic spinach, some spicy lentils, asparagus, potatoes au gratin, green beans, and whipped cauliflower . . . it's like someone made your vitamins delicious . . . and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and my beat-down-by-Vegas body was reinvigorated.  The wine selection is good, but I opted for the brewed-in-Quebec triple Belgian beer, the Fin du Monde, and like Frank the Tank would say, \"It feels so good when it hits your lips . . . so good!\"\n\nOne word of caution, though - the bathroom is out the door inside the casino and around the corner, so depending on where you're sitting, it might be a hike . . . and the water and the wine keep coming . . ."

  "text" : "The boy was right, and decided at just the right moment to have us sit down and rest our weary feet inside the Paris casino. Hey, if I can't get to Paris itself, at least give me some wine and some fountains to stare at and I'll be happy. Throw in some fancy meat and you may get lucky.\n\nThe wait staff was nice and accommodating. My water was constantly refilled,and I had no idea how hungry I was until I nearly ate half the free bread on the table myself. \n\nI ordered the Salad Maison to start, lured in by the goat cheese crouton. It was your average salad, but very fresh and came with a great balsamic dressing. I can never recreate those at home. I also intended on ordering the roast pork and a lovely glass of Beaujolais, but instead, was given roast chicken and a glass of merlot. The merlot i let slide, but when I want my pork, rotisserie chicken does not suffice! Blame it on my cleavage, I know some people get distracted...but how does \"Beaujolais\" sound like \"Merlot\" and hows does Pork Roast, sound like \"chicken\"? \n\nThe waiter was also an original Nor Cal native and very nice, so I wasn't bothered. I got a complimentary refill on my merlot and my pork came shortly thereafter. I passed the time munching on the boy's veggie plate--which I did envy. It was gorgeous, full of fresh, seasonal, comfort veggies and he was a member of the clean plate club. Garlic spinach, mashed cauliflower, roasted potatoes etc... delicious.\n\nWhen my roast arrived, I blushed. I called it the \"Pork Lollypop\" since really, I don't get much fancier than ground turkey or Trader Joe's chicken strips these days on the dole. I was in pork heaven. Nestled gently on a pile of mashed potatoes with succulent roasted carrots wedged on it's sides, this roast was bathed in a savory citrus sauce--like nothing I've ever tasted, and probably won't for a while more. \n\nExcellent service, reasonable Vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor. It was dimly lit, sexy and I had a view of the Bellagio fountains from the table, minus the 20 degree wind chill factor. Oo la la!"

  "text" : "I have visited this bistro several times since Paris hotel and casino is one of my favorite casinos to visit when I am in Vegas.  I was also familiar with the original in Chicago.\n\nThis last visit was not a happy occassion but you can only stand homecooked food for a certain time before you decide to go out when you visit family.\n\nThe meal itself was good, I had steak dijon well done (as requested)and my partner had the skate.  He had the soup of the day vegetarian style (very good) and I had the salade maison. \n\nOverall the whole meal was satisfactory including the drinks.  One note, bistros are normally small in France and in the context of Vegas, nothing is small so this one has a lot of space and its outdoor patio has the view of the dancing fountains of Bellagio.  \n\nThe service itself is exemplary except for the wait.  The salad and the soup came on a reasonable time but the entree was really a long wait.  In any restaurant, this is not excusable especially for a place not really very crowded.  When you finish the appetizer/soup/salad, you expect the dinner to come at an appropriate time.  Little quibble but prices should reflect overall service, food, timing and other extras.\n\nOne more thing, great warm bread and always ask for more if you are really enjoying, it will be good for your soup and waiting on the rest of the dinner.\n\nNo dessert to review, only had espresso. Overall recommended but not highly."

We had wanted to check out the Paris hotel and get a bit to eat and Mon Ami Gabi was one of the only restaurants still open in the hotel. It did take us quite a while to decide what we wanted seeing as the menu is mostly steak and neither me or the bf are quite fond of it. I settled on the lemon chicken, with hesitation because it didn't seem very French but was one of the only things that appealed to me. The bf had the salmon and both turned out to be very good. The mini baguette and butter was also quite tasty and the restaurant is very cute inside. My favorite part of the meal, however, was the sparkling rose', of which I had two glasses.\n\nI would recomment Mon Ami Gabi if you are a fan of steak and don't mind paying $30 for it."

  "text" : "Full disclosure: I used to work at Harrah's Entertainment, which owns Paris Las Vegas.\n\nI wish I liked this restaurant more than I actually do.  \n\nMon Ami used to be my go-to for a good solid dining experience at a reasonable price on the Strip.  I'd get seats outside on the patio, and on a nice LV night, you have a fantastic experience, watching the degenerate LV tourists and having a front row seat to the Bellagio water show.  I have probably been there about half a dozen times.\n\nThe service is generally very friendly and competent.  The food, in the past, has been quite good.  Prices are mid-level for Las Vegas.  The restaurant is very dark, depending on where you sit, and so it's really difficult to comment on the decor.  \n\nHowever, the last time I ate there (September 2008), the food was cold and took forever.  I had put my name in but waited far longer than expected.  I don't mind dealing with the latter, but the former really made me an unhappy camper, particularly because it's always been so good in the past.  Another disappointment was that the ginger ale that used to be served was very authentic ginger ale, and very tasty.  Unfortunately, that's changed over to cheap Canada Dry-style ginger ale.  \n\nAn annoying feature - you cannot make reservations in advance.  You basically have to show up and put your name in, then wait around forever.  This of course, delights Harrah's Entertainment, owners of Paris (though the casino does not own Mon Ami Gabi, unlike some of the other eateries on the property).  \n\nBased on my last experience, I find myself very hesitant to recommend this restaurant to friends, so I sadly can't very well recommend it on Yelp, can I?  You'll probably do better if the restaurant isn't slammed (we were there on a Saturday night, peak dinner rush this last time).  At least, I hope so.\n\nThe restaurant is right off the Strip, so expect a nice long walk from the garage.  It can be noisy, and I generally wouldn't characterize it as being a romantic restaurant in a traditional sense (quiet, intimate), but it might be enjoyable if it returns to its roots."

But when I got there, I found out that reservation was only good for inside tables. Outdoor table was walk-in only. Well, we weren't too hungry and the wait was 15 - 30 min, so we waited. The tables were really packed, and they have a heater between every table which made it even more packed. People actually ducked under the heater to get to their seat, which could potentially light their hair on fire.\n\nThe waitress was pretty friendly and we didn't expect too much given they were busy. The bread that they served was warm and fresh out of the oven. We ordered a French Onion Soup and the Soup du Jour, Lobster Bisque. They were both pretty good. Lots of cheese in the onion soup and they poured the bisque from a pot at the table. Then we had a Bacon Cheeseburger with Bleu Cheese and a Fish and Frites. They were delicious. The pommes frites side was one of the best. Oh, I ordered a latte, and it smelled and tasted extremely well.\n\nThe ambiance, the food, and the service were not bad. It wasn't amazing, but I enjoyed it. It has a lot of potential. I might come back again for dinner. Hopefully, they won't be as busy.\n\nOn a side note, there's the thing about people in Vegas. They are rather pretentious and trashy. The table right next to us was really LOUD. The women have big blond hair, and one of the men wore a cowboy hat. Guess where they're from. They were probably one of those people who would stand on the left side of an escalator. I could hear everything they said and I actually had to raise my voice so that my friend can hear me."

The food and service was exactly as described on Yelp! \n\nWe started with the Escargots de Bourgogne - when we asked our attentive and very friendly waitress what escargots tasted like, she said \"garlic\".

The single best server to ever serve me served me here, and the single best oyster experience I've ever had I've had here. Three times.\n\nWines are around $10 per glass, food is around $20+ per lunch entree."

The mushroom crepe was amazing, but the \"salad\" they mention in the menu is actually less than a normal place's plate dressing.  Honestly, not a salad.  The French sangria (frangria) was good enough I got a carafe and finished most of it myself (although that could have just been the mood we were in).  We were seated outside with shade so weren't too hot or too cold and until some jerk started smoking towards the end of our experience it was perfect.  The waitress was clearly a pro and very friendly."

Several in the party wanted a glass of wine but didn't know what so were looking for suggestions (note: only French wines here, no CA ones.)  She went out of her way to bring over 4 different bottles of wine (opening 2 of them just for us) for them to taste.  And did it all with a smile.   \n\nI wasn't that hungry so only had the butter lettuce salad and the mac and cheese (macaroni gratin) on the appetizer menu but I LOVED them both. I had a taste of my husband's steak (Steak Classique) and it was delicious.  Everyone else seemed to thoroughly love their food as well.  \n\nWe were too stuffed to try dessert - but I will save room next time!\n\nIf you sit outside or near the front window, you can see the Bellagio fountains so that is very nice.\n\nI dislike most things French (cheese and bubbly are noted exceptions but really...still done better in CA) but this was quite yummy without the attitude at most French restaurants (yes, Masa's in SF I am talking to you.)\n\nI would definitely come back here on my next trip to Vegas."

Our waiter, Chris, was there and attentive with a warm bagguette and a carrot salad that my girlfriend loved, I only got one bite.  Next Chris suggested a bottle of wine which was perfect.  We started with Duck Confit, which was amazing the tastes and textures were unbelievable.  We both ordered steaks which were perfect.  Here you can order the cut of meat then any of the sauces you want, these steaks were great.  and the frittes cannot be described you need to have these.\n\nWe were not rushed through our meal, nor did we wait on any of the courses, Chris kept our wine glasses full and was very nice.  We savored our meal for 2 hours as we watched the bellagio water show 5 or 6 times, and the river of people on the sidewalk would be worth it to watch anytime.  \n\nThis is hands down my favorite resturaunt on the strip, it is perfect\n\noh and it was a little windy last night but the angles of the building and the heaters made it just fine to wear a short sleeved shirt."

The patio door was open which isnt so bad but they also had the AC on blast. Helloo its almost 10pm and it was 60 degrees outside!\nOur waiter. Such a miss. I asked if Marlin was working that night and he wasnt ;( Our waiter was TERRIBLE. \nHe was unattentive, flat out ignored us, took forever, wasnt professional and really didnt have a good persoanlity. Smile a little!\nThe worst were the slow bustboys. They left us with our dirty plates for too long, reached across the table to serve food and lifted plates ABOVE my head to clear things away. Derfinately not ok in our book. \nThe food was generally very good as always. Their special of fish in Saffron sauce was NOT good and we sent it back. Luckily that was refunded on the bill. \nSteaks, frite, and desserts (Creme Brulee and Flourless Chocolate Cake were VERY good). \n\nI will definately come again because its worth it.

As I have frequently dined at the Mon Ami Gabi in Bethesda, Maryland, I pretty much knew what to expect - good food and service. (unlike my experience at Les Halle in Washington DC, where I had excellent food and an asshole for a waiter)  I can easily say that Mon Ami did not disappoint.\n\nAfter about a 20 minute wait, we were sat outside.  Immediately, fresh bread was brought to our table and our drink and food orders were placed (when in France, order Kronenbourg).  Our food arrived promptly. I had the mushroom quiche which I thoroughly enjoyed an my wife had the chicken and gruyere cheese crepe, which was tasty as well.   \n\nThe restaurant is also across the street from the Bellagio, so we were treated to two fountain shows (one of which was Frank Sinatra...it doesn't get better than that). \n\nIn all, a great place to enjoy an outdoor lunch on a nice, sunny day."

She smiled at us, told us what to order and was, with her limited English, much more helpful than our English-speaking server.\n\nOur waiter was incredibly haughty. Give me a break, dude. You know it's a problem if I leave a restaurant and have had only had one drink. The one drink I was able to order was very tasty, however, and it probably did Brian a favor seeing how I would not get in a taxi without a drink for our entire stay in LV (Read: Johnna was drunk for the length of our stay.) God, I loved drinking in the taxi more than anything. I even tried to bring my drink into Fashion Mall and Brian said no. Anyway, back to what you came here for.\n\nAs I was saying the service was crappy. We weren't checked on at all, but luckily, the filet (once it finally came out,) was really, really, really fucking good and prepared properly. I even took a picture of it. They served it with some delicious crispy fries in a shape I've never seen-like thin fry strips. I would have loved these lightly drizzled with a vinaigrette or sprinkled with sea salt. They need to edit this side in some way to make it more special.\n\nOverall, our meals were absolutely delicious-but  the best steak we had in Vegas wasn't here... that bad boy was in another hotel restaurant in the Venetian. I'll be getting to that.\n\nCouples, this is where you go for some Vegas ambiance. Sit out on the patio at night in April; the weather is divine. If you get a seat on the street edge, you will have a full view of the Bellagio fountains-unless you are seated at the only table with bush right in front of it. WTF. That's OK. I got to stare at my sweetheart and the somewhat interesting male couple to my right. Unfortunately, we could hear Celine Dion from our table. This is why the waiter needs to bring me another drink, or at least check to see that we're still alive.\n\nOK, points to remember about Mon Ami Gabi:\n\n1. Sit outside, weather permitting.\n2. Bring a hot date/boyfriend/lover.\n3. Ask the busser/water girl what to order.\n4. Don't expect great service.\n\nLoved it, but can't get over the pissy service... minus one star."

It is toward the front of the property, but you cannot enter from The Strip.  You must walk into the casino to gain access.  Don't try to jump the rail outside if you have had too much to drink as that would be tres uncool.  The outdoor seating is unique and is highly recommended unless it is during the day or raining.

They start you out with very tasty crusty bread and butter and a coleslaw-type salad which is very refreshing.  I ordered a special lemon tarragon halibut which was fantastic, and my friend ordered a salad with salmon and citrus (she said that it was very delicious with a nice large portion of salmon).  Our waiter was very attentive and my water glass was refilled very quickly.....I will definitely eat here again, as I REALLY want to try the steak, and hopefully next time I will be able to sit outside and watch the fountain show @ the Bellagio :)"

  "text" : "HANDS DOWN, \n\nTHIS is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas & it has been for years. I've been coming to Vegas since I was a bump in my moms tummy. So no I don't really categorize myself as a tourist. I've been to several restaurants and I gotta say i LOVE this restaurant. My love distribution is 80% location and 20% food.\n\nThis is possibly the BEST LOCATED restaurant in all of Vegas, if you're a people watcher. It's a classy restaurant right in front of Paris LITERALLY ON THE STRIP, facing the Bellagio water show. You have the option of eating indoors (being boring) or outdoors (where all the action is) on a semi-elevated platform/balcony where all the tourist are walking and passing you by. It's exactly how several restaurants are in real Paris, which YES I have actually been to FRANCE. The only difference is that you watch all the crazyness of drunken pedestrians/traffic, watch the singing water show across the street and watch the advertising trucks with pictures of almost-naked hookers. It's great! lol\n\nThe food is pretty good and pricey and that's fine with me. It's mostly different types of steaks and frites. The drinks are pretty strong as well. The special cocktails they make aren't so strong, so just order your regular drinks like you would at a normal full bar. You're bill could possibly freak you out at the end, which it always does with me.\n\nIf you want to impress a first-timer in Vegas, this is definitely the place you wanna go. You get good food, enjoy the freak show of people walking or driving on the strip AND they have great views of the strip which is good for pictures.\n\nI can go on about this place forever..."

  "text" : "I've been to Mon Ami Gabi three more times since my initial review and this has definitely become my go-to restaurant when I'm in Vegas and I want a guaranteed good meal for a moderate price. If you can, I highly recommend dining on the patio - you can't request it when you make a reservation, but when you check in, they will ask. \n\nMy favorite dish is the sea scallop dinner - I've had it twice and it has not disappointed. The scallops are always cooked perfectly and you get six. The scallop appetizer was fine, but the entree is by far the better choice. The baked cheese appetizer which I had this past weekend when I dined at Mon Ami Gabi with two friends was a big winner with our group, but how can you go wrong with goat cheese and tomato sauce? I am not a big dessert person, but the chocolate mousse is amazing.\n\nService is always very friendly and attentive. When my friend's steak on Saturday night wasn't cooked exactly how she wanted, our server got it taken care of right away. Before tip, I always seem to spend around $40 which includes wine (either a glass or a portion of a bottle), my meal, and maybe a portion of dessert. I never leave disappointed and will go back to Mon Ami Gabi on another trip."

  "text" : "WOW, This place is amazing, especially at night with all the lights. Great for a date or with friends. You get a great view of Bellagio's water show. Man, talk about romantic. \n\nThe service is great, maybe because my group had an awesome waiter... (apparently he DJs on the side)! Shout out to him if he reads this! So they provide a baguette to munch on while you wait for your food. The fries are great because they aren't your average fries. They are cut differently and lightly salted. MMMM good. \n\nI'd highly recommend the trout grenobloise. I am lactose intolerant so they customized it to my dietary restrictions. And it was still delicious!!! My friend had the pork tenderloin. Boy was it tender! Again, I'd recommend the trout and the fries. \n\nSurprisingly, this place is pretty affordable considering its smack dab on the strip. I'm a frugal person so to spend 19 bucks on dinner... I can't complain. Plus the portions are pretty generous. So this place does deserve the 5 stars. I hope to come back here soon or at least hope that they bring it out to San Diego!"

So they gave us the next best thing: table bordering the patio. It was an awesome view, I would say it's better than being out on the patio. We just went this past weekend and it was unseasonably cool and pleasant for Vegas. Bellagio fountains and weather made for a great dinner. \n\nWe had the escargots to start. It was decent, I say too much butter. I had the bone-in ribeye with a side of Macaroni Gratin. The steak could have been more flavorful, but still good. The Mac gratin was very good. Service by Matt was good as well. \n\nThe restaurant has a great ambiance and that's what makes this place. Go, the food is decent and the view is unlike any other."

  "text" : "There's really one thing that makes this place - the patio, which is right across the street from the Bellagio. It's a perfect dining spot. The one thing to keep in mind is that the patio is first come/first served, so you may want to stop by just before (or as) they open if you don't want to sit around waiting.\n\nFortunately, the food is also very tasty. Both times I've been there I had some form of a steak, which, of course, is served with fries. The fries are cut very thin, very crispy, a tad on the greasy side, and oh so very tasty. Spend the extra few dollars for the filet rather than going with the normal strip steak they serve.\n\nThe service is very solid - very good, quasi-high class but not snooty.\n\nAnd for the location and food I think the prices are rock solid. Just a few dollars more than the Outback down the street.\n\nWhenever people ask where to have dinner in Vegas I always recommend this place."

Big thick slices.  Even the jam was like homemade. I know it is only toast but it was so good. I had the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions for $11.50. The eggs where pouched and huge. I think they might have been duck eggs. Very rich dark yokes like free range grass feed poulty give you. The stew was very rich and tasty. Coffee is great and my server was always there to fill it up. I also ordered the flaky Pain Au Chocolat for $3.50.  My husband had the made by scratch blueberry waffles for $10.95. He said they where the best he has had. Looking at other people plates made me wanting to try it all. Next trip for sure."

My only complaint to the staff would be: Please turn off your gas-lit lights when it's 100 degrees outside and sunny.  I literally thought my face was going to melt into my delicious beer.

My boyfriend & I came here on our last night in Vegas. We requested outdoor seating and we lucked out with, what I think is, the best seating. We got the corner seating with a PERFECT view of the Bellagio watershow and didn't have numerous people walking back and forth right in front of us. \n\nWe ordered the pate, salmon, steak bearnaise (?), french onion soup. Everything was delicious, very decent sized portions and very filling. I would go into more detail but I'm too lazy. Basically, you can't fail with any of these choices. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty interesting. Right when you walk into the restaurant, it's pretty dim and seems more like a romantic setting but as you walk toward the outdoor seating, the atmosphere gets more lively. Or maybe that was just my take on it all.\n\nBasically, this is a great place for a date or even for a group to come here. Sitting outside is awesome (but be sure to do it later in the evening when it isn't scorching hot)."

For spitting out masses amounts of food, the food was Very Good. We had crabcakes for one of our courses that was definitely one of the best Crabcakes ever! Lots of Crab! I picked the scallops as my entree (over mashed cauliflower), other than the scallops being a tidbit over cooked it was really good. Dessert: Choc Cake = Awesome! Decent cocktails!

My request was simple: \"Somewhere outdoors with a view of the strip where we can chill, drink, eat some good food and people watch.\" Surprisingly, there was only one place that fit my demands: Mon Ami Gabi!\n\nApprehensively we drove over to Paris expecting a wait at the restaurant that would damper the plans but surprisingly most of the outdoor seating was available when we showed up at around 5:00 pm. We got a prime seat outside facing the Bellagio. Picture this: sangria, setting sun, water show, slight breeze with beautiful weather. Ah...Vegas - you gotta love it.\n\nWe ended up ordering the escargot (delicious) and the skate wing (kind of fishy flavored, a bit disappointing) to share. However, I gotta admit that the whole experience was not really about the food, more about the ridiculously relaxing and beautiful experience.\n\nSo again I say: I love love love this place. Usually when I'm in Vegas I'm just too hungover and in pain and I'm so glad we stopped in at Mon Ami Gabi to just stop for a second, chill, and experience the good life =)"

We immediately ask if we could sit outside, and the hostess is quick to tell us there is no shade whatsoever if we choose to sit out there.  (Hmm...it's like over a hundred degrees today!)  So, we decide to sit inside, but as we are headed out, I notice a handful of people sitting in the blazing heat and we decide to go for it.  Smack dab in the middle of the patio and perfect for people-watching!\n\nIt's a quick peek at the menu and we're set to go!  Waters arrive shortly, along with warm French baguettes and butter.  The bread and butter is SO good, and just so French!  Yum!\n\nOur food soon arrives:\n* Mussels Mariniere with frites ($21.95 full order) - Loaded with tons of onions, we start digging in.  One of my favorite things about eating mussels is the yummy sauce that comes with it, perfect for dipping warm French bread into!  What I don't like is finding the beard still attached to the mussel.  Sure, I can let one go.  But there were at least four mussels were I was spitting the beard out.  Yuck.  The frites are usually one of my favorite parts too, but I wasn't digging their version here.  It's more like deep-fried potato sticks\n\n  * County Style Pate \"cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast\" ($9.95) - The pate was just okay, nothing spectacular.  You take a piece of pate and put it on the country bread, and take a bite.  Have a cornichon too while you're at it.  But it wasn't something that transported me back to the French countryside.\n\nOur waiter also forgot The Husband's Kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding.\n\nService was good in the beginning with our water glass being filled often and more baguettes coming our way.  Then I think there was a shift change because all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check.  We also noticed that we didn't get any kind of dipping sauce for our frites, but noticed other tables automatically got ketchup.  I would have been happy with mayo!\n\nOverall, I guess I was expecting more - from the service and the food.  Everyone raves about this place, and I was left feeling underwhelmed.  The location is perfect, and if you sit outside, it's fabulous for people watching and the Bellagio water fountain show.  Perhaps I'll go again and further explore their menu."

But this time - yuk! \n\nFirst, server appeared before we had even fully sat down (I was still trying to figure out where to set my purse) and asked what we wanted to drink. Told her we needed a few mintues - bad move as she did not return for a full 20 minutes. We had chosen a bottle of wine and an appetizer for the table, but she refused to take the appetizer request until she went and got the wine! When she returned with the wine she proceeded to fill my glass nearly to the brim. This is a pet peeve of mine. When I spend $80 for a bottle of wine I want it poured correctly so that there is room in the glass to aerate it and develop the flavor.\n\nAnyway, we remind her of the appetizer we want and order our meals. Appetizer never came. Waited 25 minutes and salads arrived. Told her we never got the appetizer we ordered and she said, \"oh sorry, we won't charge you for it then\". Less than 5 minutes later the entrees arrived and she tried to take the salads away even though we had barely had a chance to touch them!\n\nWe had ordered the steaks cooked \"medium\" and they came cold in the middle. Returned them for more cooking - another 20 minutes go by. Finally she delivers the steaks again and also the bill! We mention that we just might want to look at a dessert menu once we have finished the meal, so she runs right off and brings one to us.\n\nWe try to eat the rest of our meal, while she continually visits the table to ask if she can take plates away and if we want dessert. When we do finish she is nowhere to be seen. We give up and pay the bill and go elsewhere for dessert.\n\nThis evening was pretty much a total loss. Was embarrassed because I picked the restaurant and was telling my friends how good it was. I'll think twice before going here again. There's just too many good restaurants in Vegas to take a chance on this one again."

  "text" : "As I sit here watching Andrew Zimmern eat snails in France, all I can think about is Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nIt has become a birthday tradition; every year, I go to Mon Ami Gabi.  Twice.  Once with my brother, who, if possible, is even more of a Foodie than I am.  Then one more time with whomever I am in Vegas with (ex-husband, friend, friends......random stranger I met at Peppermill). \n\nI've tried almost everything on their menu (including things that they don't have any more and need to bring back, like the arugula and goat cheese crepes), and it is all phenomenal.   In order of how much of a food-orgasm they give me:\n\n1.) Escargot.  I've had a surprising amount of escargot in my life, and this is the ish.  Buttery, garlic-y, AMAZING texture; one order is often not enough.  Because my baby bro and I love them so much we sometimes get two orders.\n\n2.) Crepes.  Ohhh...the crepes.  One birthday, I did the double trip twice in one day; brunch the first time, late dinner the second.  The best crepe of my life was here, the aforementioned arugula and goat cheese crepe.  I had never had arugula cooked before, and its peppery flavor was perfectly complimented by the very mild and creamy goat cheese.  I have never seen it on the menu again, and every time I go I ask for it and everyone claims to have never heard of it.\n\n3.) French martini (vodka, chambord, pineapple, up).  No brainer.  They do it better than anyone.\n\n4.) Frites.  Ohhhhhhhhh the frites.  Crispy.  In large quantity. \n\nTheir steaks are great, try one at least once, and I recommend the Dijon or Bordelaise.  I'm not saying it is the best steak I've ever had (Morton's tied with a random place in Kansas get that award) but it is REALLY good, and their sauces are incredible. \n\nYou can make reservations online which is very helpful for weekends and busy evenings.\n\nMake sure you ask for a spot on the patio so you can have the perfect view of the Bellagio fountain. The covered part of the patio is well air conditioned during the summer and well heated in the winter.  The uncovered part has heat lamps in winter and is near nice little spray misters in summer (they don't spray on you, but somehow help keep the air cool near you).\n\nThe servers don't wear nametags....just numbers.  Why? \"We at Mon Ami Gabi think the experience should totally be about you....our names don't matter\".  I do find this a little silly, because, by drawing attention to the fact that you don't wear nametags by wearing numbertags, didn't you just make it about you?  But having a server tell me about the jokes they make in the kitchen for certain servers (#69 gets quite abused), I find it fun and hilarious. \n\nI wish they had ranch.  Dipping my frites in mayo is not appetizing.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, go.  And go hungry.  Ask for an extra baguette to take home with you.  Eat as much of those carrots that they serve with the bread (on good days) as you can.   Have a martini.  Pretend you're in Ocean's Eleven.   And eat some extra escargot for me."

And needless to say, it was right on! \n The bartender was quick to rush me my tab after ordering my drink, until I asked if I could eat at the bar. She quickly obliged. \n I asked her how the pate was and she said most like the chicken since it has a smoother consistency, and the meat was a little too chunky for most. \n Meat pate it is! Good. Full of flavor. Nice texture. Not really like a true pate though. Still enjoyable. Came with cornichons, cocktail onions, grain mustard n toasted bread. \n The frisee and bacon salad with fried egg was delish! The egg was cooked perfectly with a nice runny yolk! \n The overall menu looks impressive, which I look forward to conquering in the future. And the prices are quite reasonable. \n Nice wine list."

We technically sat inside for breakfast, but the way the restaurant is set up, the entire front is open, facing the street and the amazing Bellagio hotel, so you're also outside more or less. It was a gorgeous, sunny day, so that made the experience that much better. We had a yogurt parfait, eggs, bacon and chocolate chip waffles (a pms ing woman's dream!!), and toast. As you are sitting there, the Bellagio fountain show goes off every so often, and sitting down relaxing with a meal is the best way to see it. It was a great, romantic experience. The food was very good, and the waitstaff very impressive. They couldn't do enough for us. Would def recommend."

The waitress made a few appetizer and entree suggestions that were very good.  After reading all the yelpers saying that their steaks are hands down one of the best things there I just had to try.  I'm not much of a beef eater but taking a leap of faith I ordered the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter Sauce.  Oh boy it was melt in your mouth delicious!  The sauce was just perfect , the sauce was in no way overwhelming and it was cooked to perfection.  It was served with potatoe frites (similar to shredded potatoe chips, not thick as french fries).  \n\nWe also ordered the Escargot and bake cheese as appetizers.  I love cheese and their baked cheese had this tomatoe base mixed in with the creamy cheese.  If you love tomatoes and cheese it's really good with the bread.  The Escargot were baked shell-less with a wonderful olive oil pesto sauce.  It was just yummy.  After all the Escargots disappeared I had an idea to dip my bread into the pesto sauce that was still in the pan.  \n\nFor Dessert we had the Banana Foster Crepe.  It was big ennough to share and was wonderfully delightful!\n\nThings to try:\n\n-Escargot\n-Baked Cheese\n-Seared Scallops served with Cauliflower puree (taste just like mash potatoes almost)\n-Hanger Steak (If you don't mine chewing a bit and a little gamey)\n-Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter Sauce\n-Crab Cakes\n-Oysters on a half shell\n-Creme Brulee\n-Banana Foster Crepes\n\nThe servers were very polite and if you want to try out their oysters, they actually give you a sample of one before committing to a full tray of them."

  "text" : "French Steakhouse at Paris hotel with a view of the Bellagio water show? Sounded like a perfect dinner date! Unfortunately the only appeal to this place is the location, which is absolutely amazing being able to sit through the water shows every 15 min during dinner. The food? Not so much.\n\nWe received french bread and butter to start, just standard hard bread, not warm at all. \nAs an appetizer we had the Escargot, pretty good but only because it was heavily drenched in butter and a pesto that made eating snails tolerable.\nWe also shared a French Onion Soup -- served in a nice deep \"pot\" of a bowl, good for 2 people. Looked tasty, but was somewhat bland. The broth had no bite to it whatsoever, no hint of Sherry, just tasted like normal beef broth with plain onions.. note: onions were not caramelized. Very subpar as far as French Onion Soups are concerned.\nThe main course sounded so delish. I ordered the Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onions and red wine sauce) while the BF had the Steak au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce). I ended up liking the flavor of the Bordelaise much better, although both steaks were quite large and thin.. I don't know if French steaks are usually like this but it wasn't enjoyable whatsoever. Even a McDonald's burger patty is thicker than these steaks.. no joke. The pommes frites served with them are very reminiscent of potato chips.. not sure if all pommes frites are like this but they were just okay. $24 per plate? please.\n\nThe bill came out to $82.. without drinks. I think their strategy is to have their guests mesmerized watching the water show and not care so much about the quality of food. Sorry, but, we noticed.\n\nOverall:\nLocation - 5 stars\nFood - 2 stars\n= 3 stars\nand prices are a rip, even though this is Vegas, an $80 dinner can buy you way better stuff than this."

  "text" : "The 3 stars is a push.  It was actually quite good, but the fairly poor service and bathrooms with a line-out-the-door in the casino, I had to settle at 3.  So let's bullet point:\n\nPROS:\n- Food.  The filet mignon was absolutely delicious, in some sort of merlot sauce.  I believe there was also the word \"reduction\" in it, which tends to add to the fancy shmancyness.  It was about $32, so me and the boyfriend split it.  It came with an interesting side - these crispy 'fries' that actually tasted a lot better than they looked.\n- Asparagus.  Infused with butter.  Nuff said.\n- The waiter was from SD and super cool.  Definitely a surfer/stoner type, and we enjoyed his company.\n\nCON:\n- There is no restroom in the actual restaurant, so have fun waiting in line with a bunch of drunk Cougars and the 20 something year olds waiting patiently on the outiside to pick out the ripest (drunkest, or bustiest, whatever was closest) one.  Kinda ruined the fancy French restuarant vibe.\n- The poor water guy spilled water essentially all over my placing.  He was nice about it, but everything I used that night was pretty wet.\n- Actual waiter was cool, but completely forgot that we had ordered a bottle of wine, and didn't even get it until after our steaks were served.\n\nComplaints are minor, and food was delicious.  If you're going to spend $30+ for a steak, I would neutrally recommend this place.  If that even makes sense."

But that aside, considering what I paid and what I got, I was definitely satisfied.  BF and I split the filet mignon with merlot butter reduction.. the steak also came with these crispy little steak fries that I didn't think I would like.. but they went really well with the sauce and the steak.  We also split some side dishes: french green beans and macaroni gratin.  Everything was really good.  Our steak was a little more cooked than what we asked for; we got medium-well instead of medium.  But it was still good.  And of course, the green beens were cooked perfectly and the macaroni gratin was absolutely yummy.  We also ordered a bottle of bordeaux which, unfortunately, the waiter forgot about until after our steaks had arrived.. but no serious damage was done :)\n\nMy total share of the bill came to $40 (that's including tip).  Not bad considering I had filet mignon, two sides, and a full glass of wine.

The bread is just delicious and does remind you of genuine French baguettes which have such a unique taste and texture. \n\nLunch was less than perfect. I chose Moules Marinieres which is one of my favorite lunch dishes (especially when served with real frites!). However Mon Ami Gabi fell short. The broth was way too creamy and while the mussels were decent you just couldn't get past the fact that a pretty basic dish had been executed poorly. The frites were also not great, they were in between chips and frites and that's not what you need when you order a classic item like MM. I imagine people who ordered Steak Frites on the bistro style lunch menu would be similarly disappointed.\n\nUnlikely I would try dinner here with Bouchon and Daniel Boulud in town."

My pizza from a fast food place at the Venetian was more satisfying.\n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh as there were semi-positives to my meal:\n1. the french onion soup, which my server claimed was the best ever.  It was good, but I cannot agree with her claim.\n2. the french fries.  They were thin and crispy and cooked just how I like them.  I think I'm committing a faux pas by saying this, but I thought the fries here were better than the very famous Bouchon fries (which I tried the next day).\n3. the bread pudding.  Once again, my server claimed it was the best ever.  It was good, but not the best ever.  I love bread pudding and this stuff was just okay.  I've def had a lot better (the Nordstrom Cafe bread pudding is the best!)\n4. the oysters.  I didn't try these, but my bf said they were good and he loves oysters.\n\nHowever, the positives didn't really balance out the not so great entrees.\n\nMy bf ordered a roasted chicken that was flavorless.  Don't offer roasted chicken as a house special if it's going to be dry and just not good.  \n\nI ordered the fish and frites (hence the yummy french fries).  The fish was disgusting.  It was pounded down and fried as like one large circle.  I took 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore of it.  Yuck!\n\nPerhaps we should have ordered something else, but I will not be returning to eat a meal at Mon Ami Gabi (I might just order some fries to go!).

Some French restaurants in America try to recreate this tradition, but none does it as well as Mon Ami Gabi.  I eat here every time I go to Vegas.\n\nIf you go, you must get a table outside.  This will probably mean a wait of more than an hour, but it's absolutely essential.  Directly across the street from the Bellagio, you'll have front-row seats for their famous water show.  You'll also be sitting in the shadow of the famed Eiffel Tower (Vegas version), and it's a prime spot for people-watching.\n\nThe food and the service are both outstanding.  Purists criticize the food for its lack of authenticity.  I can't speak to that, but can say that the food they DO serve is fantastic -- the chicken liver mousse is to die for, their steak roquefort is seasoned and cooked to perfection, and I absolutely love their light, crispy frites.  The wait staff is attentive without being obtrusive, and there's never an attempt to rush you away, no matter how long you've been nursing that final glass of wine.\n\nThis place is perfect for both a romantic dinner for two, or a raucous dinner party of 12.

I ended up going twice, each time enjoying the eggs and bacon, an excellent roll with chocolate, and fantastic fresh squeezed orange juice. It was such a pleasant way to start the day, with people watching being one of my favorite Vegas past times. The service was attentive, our server walked to another restaurant to get us whole bananas. The smoked salmon my wife had was much cheaper then the hotel coffee shop and great according to her. I loved this breakfast for taste, value, and simplicity. \n\nNext time you are in Vegas and do not want to settle for breakfast, head to Mon Ami Gabi and have a seat outdoor along LV Blvd. and enjoy the fine decision you made."

  "text" : "If you like butter, cheese and more butter, this place is for you. While the set-up is cute (if not a bit too kitschy) and the service is very pleasant, the food tries to be French but just hits you with as much fat/grease/butter as possible. I'm always one for unhealthy food, but this was a bit much.\n\nStarters:\n-Chicken liver mousse: Good, flavorful, huge portion\n-French onion soup: The broth was good, but it was so hard to get a taste of what the soup was like with the HUGE glob of cheese on top of the soup. Now, I love cheese, lactose-intolerant as I may be, but I had to scoop the last third of the cheese out bc it was just way too much.\n\nDinner:\n-Roast chicken: This isn't the roast chicken of Bouchon, that's for sure. It was good but a bit dry...and the vegetables were so completely soaked in oil, it was hard to figure out what you were eating.\n-Skate: I love skate because it's such a nice, light fish...but again, I thouht I was eating a pound of butter mixed with some lemon and capers. The vegetable salad was a very nice accompaniment, though - very refreshing.\n-Macaroni gratin: I make it a habit to order mac n cheese at nearly every restaurant I go to, if it's available. This version literally had a pound of cheese on top; I was confused on whether there were even any noodles in the dish. Again, ended up scraping off 2/3 of the top cheese layer to even enjoy the dish.\n\nI think this restaurant has potential if they laid off the cheese/oil/butter and just let the food speak for itself. It's really not necessary to make America fatter than it already is!"

  "text" : "The day after a superb dinner at Guy Savoy (getting in later than my friends who were in Vegas to \"party\" and still waking up before them) I woke up early - feeling great I went for a run outside, the first time I'd ever done so in Vegas - what they say about it being \"a dry heat\" is right and the mornings are dry and cool - running from the Venetian down to Mandalay Bay and back I was more dehydrated than I normally am on a run twice the distance.  Drinking plenty of water and showering I'd worked up quite an appetite and made my way out for another walk south on the strip - this time to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  Arriving at 7:20am I was greeted by the friendly hostesses at the door and led promptly to a prime seat on the patio where I watched Vegas roll by - the best part about early morning Vegas is that there are only two sorts of people - the early morning joggers and the people just heading home.  I laughed like hell when a guy came up and yelled \"high five - yellow shirt - I love yellow shirts\" with regard to my vintage LA Kings T.  Only in Vegas.\n\nHaving heard much about Mon Ami Gabi's view - truly awesome sitting 4 feet above Las Vegas Boulevard and directly across from the fountains at Bellagio - I must admit I'd heard mixed reviews of the food and went in with tempered expectations.  Greeted by my server and handed a menu I was offered coffee which I graciously accepted.  A decent French Roast with heavy nuttiness the coffee was good, but probably the worst I had during my trip to Vegas...and refills were slow at best despite the restaurant being unfilled throughout my meal.  Browsing the menu I was impressed by both the sweets and the savories - deciding between the Blueberry French Toast and Poached Pear Waffles proved difficult and thus I ended up with neither.   Placing my order I also opted to order a pain au chocolate from the limited bakery menu.\n\nSitting for nearly 30 minutes while I waited for my food I sipped my coffee and watched the street - I've said it before and I'll say it again, half the \"Vegas Experience\" is people watching.  Eventually arriving along with only my first refill of coffee (I had to request it - thankfully after this service improved and a young man took over my coffee refills) I was somewhat surprised when the sweet arrived with my savory breakfast.  Cool and questionably fresh the Pain au Chocolate was appropriately buttery and flakey but lacked any pizzazz.  Featuring a small single vein of average chocolate I could've gotten the same dish for much less than $3.50 at most convenience stores.\n\nWhere I would consider the sweet a failure - I didn't even finish it - my savory at MAG was actually a unique take on a classic and quite delicious.  Described as a \"classic\" Croque Madame the dish was actually presented in a \"deconstructed\" fork and knife sandwich manner with two large slices of hearty grain bread pan fried in butter and then cut in half, topped with ham and gruyere cheese plus chives, and finished with a sunny-side up egg.  Accompanying the croque on the plate was a simple salad of frisee and vinegar and on a side plate were some oily and uninspiring (and decidedly American) hash browns with Heinz ketchup poured into a small cup.  While good this croque and accoutrements certainly wasn't as good as the version the previous day at Pinot and no-where near on par with the versions in Northern California at Butler and the Chef or Bouchon.\n\nFinishing my meal and sipping on my coffee again my female server finally returned to my table to ask if I needed anything else - when I asked for a \"to go\" cup of coffee plus the check this duty was pawned off on the young man who'd been filling my coffee while she went back to talking to the other female server near the register.  Like Pinot I simply don't understand why \"bistro\" entails sub-par service in Las Vegas and I actually mentioned on my way out suggesting that I wanted my tip (left in cash as opposed to on my credit card as I normally do on vacation) be given to the young man and not my \"server.\"  In general I can't say there is much to brag about at Mon Ami Gabi aside from the view and while the restaurant would certainly stand at the top of French cuisine in Columbus Ohio (my home) I'd much sooner go back to Pinot, Bouchon, Payard, or Tableau when in a dining destination city like Las Vegas."

  "text" : "This establishment is located in the Paris hotel, across from Bellagio. High volume is during the weekends for dinner. PLEASE try to make a reservation during the times of Christmas, NYE, and Valentines Day season. It will be very hard to get a walk-in. There is also many sections of the restaurant to be seated at. First room is the wine room, which is midly dark. Chose this room if you are there for drinks or for 'intimate' time. One problem is that it is near the front where people are walking in and out constantly. There is outside seating available, which faces the strip and Bellagio fountains. It is both good and bad, since some annoying tourist might bother you while you are eating. But the fountain show is wonderful to watch while outside. There is also a room that is inside but right behind the patio, so you get all the ambiance of the patio but you are technically inside.\n\nI believe I have eaten here four times. \n\nThe first time was with a friend for lunch and both the food and service were excellent. We were walk-ins on a Saturday during lunch. We were seated outside facing the bellagio fountains, which was beautiful.  I had clam soup, brie & garlic, Shrimp Gabi and escargot. We also ordered the Pinot Gris, which was excellent with the meal. The price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food we had (the bill came to about $120US). Everything was flavorful and fresh. Based on this meal alone, we would highly recommend this restaurant.\n\nSecond & third time was with my friends (who are yelpers as well). The third time, we sat in the room behind the patio (since it was hot outside).  I basically ordered all the same things from the first visit and it tasted just as good. These times, were had ordered dessert, which was a vanilla type of milkshake. It was incredible. \n\nFourth time, I will say I was disappointed in both the food and service. Perhaps cause one of the individuals with us was a friend of the assistant manager, and it seemed that we were being ignored or just not waited on as well as others there. The service at lunch was erratic and inattentive though the restaurant was not that busy than it had been at any of my previous meals. I wanted to try their Quiche and was not impressed. It was dry with very little flavor, and bland.  My boyfriend's meal was no better, which I believe was a steak of some kind. It was pretty dry. Even though we did not pay for this meal, the value was not nearly as good as the value the past few times. \n\nFrom my experience I would still highly recommend the restaurant. I have been to more expensive French restaurants and this place is honestly great for the price. Just do not be discouraged from one bad meal. I would say that  is a great ratio."

We were lucky this time and got a patio table facing the Belaggio fountain show (which went off every 20 mins). This restaurant is all about location, location, location. It was fun to people watch and take in the fountain show. The food is descent. We had a house salad, French onion soup (the best part of the meal), and a steak with blue cheese. Go for the patio and have a glass of the house Sangria."

  "text" : "My overall experience was very good. For a vegas restaurant, these prices are really very reasonable. You can pay more for a steak at many of the generic steakhouses inside casinos, and the wine by the glass is really very reasonable at 7 or 8 bucks per glass for their more basic wines (I had both a sauv blanc and a glass of gsm and both were good and recently opened). \n\nAs for the food:\nI started with the sea scallops which were in a mussel cream sauce. Outstanding, though perhaps a touch too much Parmesan. That's not really a complaint though... just finding something to quibble about.\n \nI had their prime rib special which looking back on it was a mistake. The prime rib was fine though not outstanding and it was reasonable at 35 dollars. It was also too much food in the end when combined with my other dishes. \n\nThe others in my party had salmon (i didn't get the verdict), the new york strip (judged good and the shallots very good), the crab cakes (judged outstanding), the salmon salad (good), as well as the french and soup du jour (a apple and parsnip soup). \n\nFor dessert two of us had chocolate mousse. The mousse was exactly what you'd hope and expect. They topped it with dark chocolate crunchy things which are good, but unfortunately just put pink berry in mind for me because they have to be exactly the same thing. Another person had the peach parfait and was a fan of it. \n\n---\nSo I'd give this 4 stars. The food was very good, but not truly exceptional, which I think it needs to be at this price range to earn a 5. The service was very good, refills on water came swiftly, and the pacing was appropriate for a French restaurant (i.e. slow, but purposefully and not annoyingly so). \n\nOf course, mention has to be made about the atmosphere. It's really nice. I asked for a table with a view of the Belaggio fountain, and they made us wait about 15 minutes upon arriving, but they gave us a good table for it. It was very pleasant. \n\nI'd definitely suggest this restaurant. I think you could probably get a better meal if you stepped up a price category somewhat, but then you wouldn't have the nice sidewalk cafe feel."

My friend and I ordered steak...I a New York Steak with Bernaise sauce....it was good, I was just not expecting the steak to look so thin and long...but I still enjoyed the steak and sauce...what I wasn't too crazy about was that they served it with a boat load of pommes frites.  Now that I know, if I go again, i will ask for veggies or something else on the side...I just don't think it went well with the meat...or maybe if there were less of them and more of something else..,but hey..maybe that's how they do it in France!  The waitress was nice and she was very helpful when my friend asked to put the bill on her players card...we found out that the restaurant is not part of the hotel so she had to go back out to the players card desk and ask for some kind of paper in order to charge the bill to the card...but it ended up working out...and it was just find.

Walked into Mon Ami Gabi without reservations and was told by the hostess that if we sat inside the restaurant we could be sat immediately. \n\nI'm not really fond of the whole faux-Paris experience anyways and would never wait 3 hours for a table on the patio... because at the end of the day, you are still in Las Vegas not France... We were sat at a nice table by the window and began the evening. \n\nThe staff and service was excellent... never once did we have to ask for anything.  Our server was polite and charming.  Placed the napkin on my girlfriend's lap and made sure the wine glass was never empty.   \n\nI ordered the Steak Béarnaise with frites.  A tender piece of flat steak cooked rare and served with a classic Béarnaise sauce.  I thought it was pretty good until I had a bite of my date's entrée and then wanted to cry. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon with merlot butter and a red wine reduction.  Perfectly cooked rare and gave me a mouth orgasm that quickly spread to the rest of my body. \n\nI really like the frites here and I will submit a signed statement saying that they are much better than the fries at Bouchon. Hand-cut freshly made crispy deliciousness that pairs well with the steak.   These are my favorite fries. \n\nWashed it all down with a couple of glasses of nice Bordeaux. \n\nFlawlessly cooked Filet Mignon, tasty frites, and amazing red wine....

I did eat here for 3 straight days for breakfast (at 2pm).  I tried everything from the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon to Salmon Eggs Benedict.  The food was awesome.  My only complaint was that the pitchers of orange juice was ridiculously expensive.  The 4 pitchers of the orange juice was about 33% of the bill for 6-8 people.  Otherwise, the food price wasn't too outrageous.  The orange juice was phenomenal but not worth the price though.  We always sat on the outdoor patio with a great view of the Bellagio fountain.  The service was somewhat slow, but I'll give them slack because this place was always busy.  At least the servers were always super nice."

  "text" : "My first time eating here was in '07, even though we have two Mon Ami Gabi outposts in Bethesda and Reston back home. However, for some reason Mon Ami Gabi in my area doesn't get half the kudos that the Vegas location does.\n\nIn any case, our first night in Vegas lead us back to Paris. We were here on October 29th and were able to secure a table without reservations. There is outdoor seating available, which is great for people watching, but as it was kind of nippy, we opted to eat inside. Our server, according to my receipt, was Dia, who was cute, knowledgeable, and provided excellent service. I ordered the Steak au Poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce, and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. Now this is where I should really listen to my friend and heed her suggestions, as she is from Oklahoma and girl knows her beef. While my steak was good, the steaks here are cut real thin. I ordered mine to be cooked medium and truth be told, when it's a thin slice of meat, you are better off asking for medium rare. Her filet mignon, of course, tasted better than mine since hers is a better cut. The generous portion of fries are hand cut and also sliced thin, fried very crisp, and are reminiscent of the won ton crispy noodles you get when you order soup at Chinese restaurants. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you want your fries to have some taste of potato, then you are best off ordering one of the side dishes. \n\nWe had also ordered a carafe of sangria (billed here as \"frangria\"), and we both agreed that it is one of the better sangrias that we have ever tried, and one of us has been to Spain. At under $16, it was enough to provide a nice buzz and was cheaper than getting multiple cocktails or ordering a full bottle of wine. They do have wine by the glass, and if you are here in the fall, you can't go wrong with beaujolais nouveau. We didn't even have to pour it ourselves, as Dia was always on the mark and filled our glasses when it got half full.\n\nFor dessert, my friend ordered the warm chocolate tarte tatin with caramel sauce and whipped cream. I got the pear parfait with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. With tax, my portion of the meal was $34.48, excluding gratuity. I can definitely recommend this place, as it was fairly inexpensive, but the amount of food, plus the service, makes for a great value. If you're not in the mood for dinner, try having dessert out on the patio with sangria, wine, or cocktails. It's a good way to start (or end) your Vegas adventure."

It was pretty much a big bowl of cheese.  I ordered the scallops which were overly salted and I tend to like my food a little more salty than others. \n\nWe sat outside overlooking the fountain at the Bellagio which was awesome.  This place has a great view of the strip. \n\nWhile eating, my husband and I noticed an employee (we assumed a manager) who kept running around talking into a mouthpiece loudly about which stage of dining everyone was on. For example, \"Just cleared apps.\" or \"Currently on main dishes\".  We both found this a little annoying. We waited for a table for over an hour and didn't want to feel rushed when it was our turn to eat."

Every dish we sampled was a new and different taste. Great salads, lovely smoked salmon, even the escargot, it being my first time, was well prepared with it's own distinct flavor. This place deserves 5 stars, outright, but for *one* huge factor. It doesn't have a bathroom. Period. You physically have to leave the restaurant if you want to/have to use the facilities, and that detracts from the ambience that they work so hard to create. Other than that? Absolutely worth it."

  "text" : "Sign this was going to be my first and only trip to Mon Ami: Having made reservations far in advance for our party of 8, the hostess refused to seat us because one single member of our party was missing in the restroom. So, rather than sit and begin to order appetizers, we were relegated to the \"time out\" corner until our bladder-busting buddy could join us. Sure, it was crowded, but not packed, and it appeared that we were one of the few groups who either a) made reservations or b) dressed as if we were going to a nice dinner and not an auto auction.\n\nEach of my friends ordered versions of the filet, some with a peppercorn sauce and others without. I went different with a hamburger (having eaten prior and also intrigued at what France would do to one of my favorite American inventions). I asked the burger be cooked \"medium\" and what I got was a blood-red mess that needed to be sent back. The meals are all served with traditional steak fries, which to me tasted like fried bits of batter and were too much like broken potato chips to eat with your fingers or a fork. Either way, it was a pretty unsatisfying meal for the $13 bucks it cost. I can't speak for the rest of the group who thoroughly enjoyed their meals. However, they had been drinking various mixed drinks for hours previous so they could have eaten fried roadkill cooked in a used gym sock and would have probably savored it with no complaints.\n\nThe only positive about the place was Frangria (which I imagine implies France's take on the traditional Spanish concoction). I now believe that it was called such based on the fact that it was Franzia boxed wine and fruit. either way, it was served in a large, chilled pitcher with delicious fruit and packed a pretty mean buzz between two adults. Definitely worth a try with dinner."

  "text" : "I'll admit that the lovely patio, overlooking the Strip and Bellagio fountains, might justify picking this restaurant. However, if you're not going here for the atmosphere, don't go here at all. The food and service are just mediocre. The free baguettes are the best part -  the French onion soup and the two apps I tried (escargot and chips with blue cheese dip) were just okay. This is French bistro fare commercialized (those from the Chicago area will know that this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, all of which I have found to be underwhelming). Service wasn't their strong suit either. When we walked in, around 6PM on a Monday evening, and told them we just wanted some drinks and apps, the hostess said she couldn't seat us for that. After looking around at the 75% empty dining room and probably looking at her strangely, she called her manager to get the OK to seat us. As someone who's worked as a restaurant server, I can tell you that any place should be thrilled to have a table like that - high tab from alcohol and quick turnover. Then our server seemed a bit out of it. So if you're just looking for a reasonably priced place overlooking the Bellagio fountains, Mon Ami will fit the bill, but if you care equally about the food and service, you'll be a bit disappointed."

We ended up getting a table on the outside patio with a straightshot view to the Bellagio water fountain.  There were trees in our view, but we still got to experience 3 or 4 water shows.  \n\nBeyond the location and environment, the food was quite good.  The first thing to note is the bread.  Fresh baguettes from the oven, properly made and served with a crisp crust and soft inside (baguettes aren't supposed to be rock hard).  We started with a dozen oysters (blue points, i think).  My parents have never had \"real\" raw oysters, having most of their experiences from AYCE asian buffets.  They were very impressed at the freshness and quality of these oysters.  Objectively, they were very fresh and tasty.  I couldn't figure out how a restaurant in the middle of the desert could have such a ready supply of fresh oysters, but nothing about the flavor or odor suggested that they weren't top notch quality.  For our main dish, our table had the chicken crepe, seafood crepe, roast beef sandwich, and the halibut.  Just about everything was good, but I especially liked the seafood crepe.  Large sea scallops adorned on a shrimp and fish crepe.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't super pricey, the food was great, and the environment was fun and refreshing.  I would definitely return."

Mon Ami Gabi is such a cute French restaurant, and if you can get patio seating, it's pretty cool outside! I went for brunch with my family, so I'm not sure what dinner is like (hence 4 stars), but their service was excellent and the food was terrific.\n\nWe actually got patio seating at first, but then the day was so windy that we asked to be seated inside again. They still gave us a seat right next to the window, so the view was almost the exact same. =) \n\nWe ordered a cream of oyster soup with a hint of saffron and something else. It was really cute how they brought it out. The waitress carried out a huge shallow bowl and a kettle and poured the soup into the bowl from the kettle! What a unique way of keeping soup warm...at least that's the first time I've seen it like that! She also brought out 4 spoons for us to share the soup. And it's sharable, believe me. It was really yummy too, and I'm not an oyster fan. But the color of the soup was almost like it wasn't cream, but butternut squash puree or something. The consistency wasn't as chunky though, but it was light and filling. Their French bread with the soup was a good pairing as well.\n\nMy mom got the chicken, spinach, and brie crepe and that thing was enormous! It was good too, but maybe could have been more savory. Perhaps because brie isn't very salty as a cheese. My dad got the quiche lorraine, which the server recommended over the leek and butternut squash quiche, and I'm glad she did because it really was good. It wasn't too dense, but of course I'm sure if my dad didn't share, it would have been overwhelming. And it wasn't just a slice either; it was an entire mini-quiche. I think this was my favorite. The cream + cheese and bacon and onions were amazing!\n\nMy sister got a chicken BLT sandwich and it came with these waffle fries, which my mom and dad loved. I wasn't such a big fan because they were a little too oily for my liking, but they had a good crisp to them . Her sandwich was really good though! And it was actually really filling too. I ordered a salmon...something with salad. haha And it was good, but I mean, how hard is it to mess up on salmon? The salad had a good dressing to it and it wasn't too overpowering.\n\nOverall, it was a delightful and refreshing brunch with very nice servers! It also wasn't terribly overpriced. I think our total bill came to be a little less than $85. =)"

This place also holds a special place in my heart for two reasons: 1) it was when I started becoming a foodie and appreciating what I ate (I'll blame it on the escargots), and 2) the first time I went to Vegas with my best friend and now-husband, we ate here and it was amazing.\n\nTwo of us arrived for a reservation for four (the other two were parking the car). Even after being told that, we were led to a corner table with only one extra chair. The guy who took us over was in a suit, so I'm assuming he was one of the managers and not a regular server. He looked more than slightly annoyed and aloof when I reminded him that we were a party of four.\n\nDespite the spotty welcome, our server was attentive and we had a wonderful time (even saw some behind-the-scenes raging in the kitchen behind us, haha), We started off with their warm bread, French onion soup, lobster bisque, sea scallops, and escargots. Everything was delicious as expected, especially the French onion soup and the massive amount of cheese. MMM!\n\nFor entrees, I had the seared salmon. It had this lemon cream on it that was soooo good. It was cooked perfectly too; it melted in my mouth. I had a bite of my husband's grilled cheese with short ribs and kinda wished I had room for that as well, haha.\n\nOur friends got a sandwich special and the trout, but I didn't have a bite so I can't comment.\n\nDessert was the profiteroles. We all said \"Oh we'll just have a small bite\" when we ordered, but we absolutely DEVOURED the thing when it came out.\n\nYes, it was a lot of food, but hey, it was New Year's day and we were living it up. ;)"

Because I have read so much about the patio seating, we decided to sit on the patio. It was incredible. Although there were trees between Paris hotel and Bellagio, you can still see the water show pretty well. Every 15 mins, you can listen to the music and enjoy the show without standing. \n\nThe best part was the food. The bread was great, and it tasted very good with the carrot topping. We had the FRENCH ONION SOUP first. Unlike other french onion soup, this broth was very light. There was so much cheese, and the cheese was good. \n\nFor main course, I had SEARED SALMON. The salmon was perfectly cooked and moist. The lemon creme fraiche was excellent! There can't be a better match.

Good for you....No. Great tasting....absolutely! \n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic with the Bellagio fountain show directly across the street. At night you can see the shows every 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is very classy looking and romantic. It has the look - and location- of an expensive place but the prices are surprisingly moderate - steaks in the low 20's, fish in the high teens and lunch crepes with a salad for about $12.\n\nOh, and not to be gross, be sure to check out the restrooms just behind the restaurant.  They have a recording playing of pick up lines and things you'll hear at the Paris.  It's English, then translated into French.  It is quit funny and amusing.  I learned how to say: \"If you were a sandwich, you'd be a Mc-Babe with Cheese.\" and \"Your father must have been a baker, 'cause you've got nice buns\".

  "text" : "There are a handful of stalwarts on the Strip, a constant stream of new offerings, and several mediocrities that survive by inertia. Few moderate venues put in the effort to maintain themselves. Mon Ami Gabi is different. After about ten years in the same location, the room looks as new (or new-old) as the day it opened. Really! The tile floors are spotless! The paint is fresh. The waitstaff are far from complacent. And the food is delivered hot and correct, starting with the complimentary warm baguette and carrot relish. \n\nModeled after an idealized Parisian bistro--but thankfully not overburdened by the cliché Lautrec prints--MAG is deceptively big (nearly 400 seats) but divided into several different sections--depending on your mood, you can sit in a dark, book-lined bar room, a warmly lit interior, a comfortable but energetic pavilion, or a boisterous Strip-side patio. The menu follows traditional French brasserie food, but goes the extra mile in terms of variety. Thus the menu includes a vegetarian sampler, fish choices including Skate, a good looking short rib, and over 10 different steak frites varieties. My Steak Bordelaise was, well, perfect. Their ribbon-style fries didn't impress though--true French frites, in my experience, are actually very close to McDonald's, believe it or not. The chicken liver pate was a healthy portion. Prices are not shockingly low, but for the Strip, strike a relative value. There's no reason you can't have that romantic dinner here for 100 dollars, instead of spending 300 somewhere else. Consistency is a quality to be praised in any restaurant--in one wth a prime Strip position that could easily coast on its vantage point, it's almost a wonder."

  "text" : "I had no background information on this restaurant, and low expectations for a place located so near the front door of a casino.\n\nI was expecting high prices and mediocre food. So we ventured further into the casino, looking at restaurants and menus, all the way to Bally's. That's when we realized that the restaurant we were meant to go to was way back at the first place we looked, Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nI love hanger steak, and it was on the menu for a mere $20. We went on a Friday night, no reservations, and were seated immediately with a choice of the patio or inside. We opted for inside, and were given seats right at the patio window. Best of both worlds, it turned out, because we had all the views of the patio and Bellagio fountains, and all the warmth of the interior.\n\nWe are not gut-buster buffet eaters.  In fact, listening to some frantic gamblers that evening talk about how they stuffed themselves silly on a comped buffet turned us right off of trough feeding. \nSo we ordered the hanger steak, medium rare, and a frisee salad with bacon and soft poached egg, and a glass of wine.\n\nLoved the sauce, coupled with the thin, crisp fries that came with the steak. And I adored all that warm yummy yolk oozing into my salad dressing. \n\nFresh, hot, crusty baguette and a pot of soft butter came to the table, along with a few mouthfuls of fine carrot salad.  We didn't need more bread, but it was so good we got a second baguette and used it to soak up the sauces of our two dishes.\n\nOn short trips, I rarely frequent one place multiple times, but felt that a breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi would be good. It was good, and we sat outside this time in the sunshine, just as the Bellagio waters were springing into action.\nThis time, unfortunately, we were in a hurry, so the experience wasn't as enjoyable. But even with more time to linger, we still would have preferred dinner there over breakfast. Of particular note in the breakfast was the bacon. Thick, streaky, but not overly fatty, flat. Like it had been roasted rather than fried. Yum.\n\nWhy 4 stars, rather than 5? I love hanger steak. I love hanger steak even more when that one strand of fiber is quietly cut from the length of the steak before it's cooked and becomes virtually impossible to remove without mincing the whole piece up.  Floss is one item the TSA will still let me take on a plane, I'd don't need it in my steak. Two quick slashes and it's gone, it's so easy and will vastly improve anyone's enjoyment of the dish.\n\nGiven the opportunity, I'd definitely come back for dinner. \n\nFor what it's worth, Ibrahim was my dinner server, and Brenda was my breakfast. Thanks!"

Evidently, the original location chooses not to advertise the server's names. She (Sharon) was quietly efficient without being too cool for the room. Amazing selection of French wines, escargot (piping hot and tasty), and oysters (super fresh with a watermelon finish).\n\nThe black cod was pure perfection, but they are best known for their filet mignon. Perfect medium rare, super buttery meat. The ribeye was 22 ounces of marbled salty bliss. Phenomenal. Terrific."

I had Eggs Benedict with Salmon and my friend had a lemon, carmel, cherry crepe  (something like that...can't remember what it was called) with homemade whipped cream.

  "text" : "My husband and I first came upon Mon Ami Gabi on a trip to Vegas back in 2000. We had just gone up the Eiffel Tower and when we came down we were hungry. It was pretty late so rather than wander the strip aimlessly looking for something to eat, we decided to head into Mon Ami Gabi and give it a try. We were so glad we did because it was one of the best meals we had on that trip. Every year we go to Vegas, every time we're there we eat at Mon Ami Gabi at least once. The steaks are perfect, the service is good and the atmosphere is wonderful. I only remember one time where one of the people in our party didn't care for their steak, they didn't realize that a hangar steak is a very tough cut. The server took note that the steak was hardly touched and when they found out they reason why they promptly removed the steak, asked what else we would like and made the substitution. The steak was comped and the subtituted item was not added to the bill. That's service! I also love Mon Ami Gabi's cocktails, in particular their Espresso Martini, so good!  All in all this is a great place that we go to again and again, wouldn't be a trip to Vegas without a stop at Mon Ami Gabi. I think we'll try the breakfast next time we go."

  "text" : "Looking at other reviews of this restaurant, I can find nothing to disagree with. Mon Ami Gabi is a great dining experience. It is in a great location right off the sidewalk which makes for great people watching. Plus having the added benefit of seeing the fountain show at the Bellagio right across the street without having to leave your seat - perfect. The food and service is top notch as well. We started with Washington state Penn Cove oysters which were briny and delicious. Main course: I selected a perfectly cooked New York strip with shallots and burgundy sauce; the galpal ordered the Steak Classique with maítre d'hôtel butter - a butter sauce thick with garlic, parsley and shallots. Out of this world! The faux Parisian décor is not too overwhelming or distracting - they manage to pull it off. An added bonus is this was one of the more reasonably priced meals of our trip. Since my wallet was hemorrhaging in the casino, this was a nice surprise."

We wanted a late lunch/early dinner before our 7:00 show, so we arrived around 4:15 and asked for a seat at one of the tables on the balcony looking across the street at the Bellagio and it's water & light show.  It was a great place to people- and fountain-watch as the sun faded from the sky.\n\nI had mussels with frites and my husband had the NY Strip steak.  We were both every happy with our meals.  The mussels were in a spicy broth with onions, garlic and possibly coconut milk.  The frites were hot and crisp and plentiful.  The hot crisp baguette was one of the best I've had in a long long time.  Mmmm.\n\nStruck up a conversation with a pair of friendly locals at the next table who were celebrating their anniversary.  Service was very good, even though we were there at a shift change."

Topped off by the fact that the bread came in a bag with the restaurant's cheesy logo stamped on it and when I went to wipe my bread crumbs off the table, noticed that the linen tablecloths were covered in butcher paper, this restaurant did not live up to the expectation presented by the concierge that referred us to it. \n\nI think if we had gone in with the expectation that this restaurant was run of the mill, it would have been okay.

  "text" : "Ate here with a group, and it was good, but not to the five-star level.  I started sharing the escargot, which was a first for me.  They tasted like mushrooms, which I guess is was most people say.  Chalk one up for the adventure but I'm not sure if I'd get them again.  Next, I had the oysters, which were good except for the horseradish, which was too chunky.  The caesar salad had a little too much dressing but it was still a little bland.  For dinner, I had the filet with merlot butter, which apparently was the same filet I had last time that I didn't especially like (but it still obviously looks good on the menu because I still got it).  It was cooked well, and the merlot butter gives it a different taste... not necessarily bad, but not what I was expecting (which is why I didn't like it the first time).  I didn't eat any of my fries and I would have much rather had something else.  For dessert, I tried the bananas foster crepe, which was delicious!  \n\nOverall, an alternative to a fancy steakhouse, but beware of the unique steaks.   The fries were excessive (yes, I know, that's why people like this place), but the desserts were good."

  "text" : "If you're looking for mouth watering steak, look no further than Mon Ami Gabi. They start you out with a complementary loaf of French bread and delicious butter. We ordered the lobster bisque which was an acquired taste I thought, and I ended up liking the soup a lot. For my entree, I had the filet mignon cooked medium which melted right in my mouth. The filet had some kind of butter merlot sauce that was simply amazing. The fries were a delicious addition to balance out the taste. My boyfriend had the New York Strip steak which had some kind of red wine reduction and peppercorn which complimented the steak very well. His steak was also very tender an juicy. The server was great and made very good suggestions when asked. He recommeneded a white wine called Vouvray, which had a sweet taste to it. Although I read that it's great with seafood, I felt it paired well with steak also. Basically, the food is amazing. Some of the best steak I've had in a while. This is my second time going and they have been very consistent. The portions are a good size for individual servings and the prices are well worth it and affordable for the food and experience.  \n\nI recommend outside patio seating because you get an added view of the Bellagio fountains. Hint hint for a perfect date setting or even a night out with friends."

You can see a great view of the Bellagio fountains, however some of the trees across Las Vegas Blvd. hinder the the view of the water show.  It's a great place to dine to people watch or to just get down on the food.  I ordered a fish dish the sole (off the valentines day menu), and my friend ordered the signature filet w/merlot butter sauce which came with frites (more like soft potato-ish chips).  The steak was amazing.  very juicy and tender and the sauce was to die for.  For an appetizer we had the scallops which were my favorite and also had the jumpo shrimp which was so-so.  Wines were good and service was great!  I would def go back and dine there again.  The prices aren't too bad, dinner entrees from $17-31."

The merlot butter left a dry aftertaste in my mouth that was not enjoyable. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare so they get kudos for that. The duck my husband ordered was dry. The ambiance was romantic, but very crowded. The service was good. \n\nOverall, I don't think we'll be coming back to this place. If you still want to try this place out, I would recommend that you make reservation online because there is always a wait. You can even request where you want to sit (i.e. indoor, outdoor, window, etc.) and the front desk will try to accomodate you the best they can."

  "text" : "Don't let the fact that this place is inside the Paris Casino fool you.\n\nMy Friend Gabi, you were so delish.  Paris Casino has dropped from its prime, if it ever was on same level as the other major properties so you wouldn't expect the food at this place to be at such a high level.\n\nSince the wait was crazy long for outdoor seating, I opted for sitting inside which was fine because it reminded me of the autumn brunches and afternoons I had in Paris, very traditional decor inside with dark rich colors.  The tables here just like in Paris are crammed together.  The service was great, I had the plate du jour, which was a Meatloaf Sandwich, this is a classic French Bistro so the bread they give you was incredible enough, and the bread for the sandwich did not disappoint either.  The meat in the sandwich was yummy, but it was rather petite, the fries that accompanied the sandwich was a disappoint though.  They were crispy but too thin for me, and this is a French bistro so why are you offering me ketchup?  I had to ask for mayo, and out comes this big-ass gravy boat of mayo, they didn't have any small sauces cups or something.  Besides the size the mayo tasted like homemade, French people love mayo to the point that they will make their own, and this is not home-made.\n\nOh I had a drink which was okay too, really decent price, good joint, MAKE RESERVATIONS (online or phone), sit outside unless it is sweltering and enjoy."

We've been here numerous times and the food and service are both nearly perfect every time. However, accommodating customers in their very tiny bar (or the back bar, which is also small and often quite busy)while waiting for the remaining members of your party is a bit cramped and they won't budge on policy at all. If you're entire party is not at the host desk they won't seat you, even if you're just waiting for the elderly members of your party to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant. While I do understand their policy to some degree, I wish they had a, \"if the majority of your party is here we'll seat you\" policy instead. The food here is worth a little wait though, as they really do strive to be authentically french in sin city. Great steak and fish dishes, a good variety of wines to choose from and wonderful desserts make this a place worth visiting twice! Also, their porch makes for great people watching right in the heart of the Las Vegas strip!"

  "text" : "From looking at all the pictures on yelp, MAGR looked like a pretty casual  bistro feel eatery, but i guess at night it's oooh la la time! I made reservations for a group of 7 and we were seated within 15 minutes  at  round table in the corner.  It was the perfect spot!  when you look up, the celings are so high and the hanging lamps were very rustic looking! I loved that they sat us at a round table.  I hate when you have a large group and they seat you in a rectangle shaped table where you have to lean forward to talk or look at the person you are talking to.  \n\nFOOD:\nWe started with the Country pate which was too course for my palate.  We were deciding between the Country or the Mousse, but we all thought the mousse would be too moussey ( is that a word?).  the flavor was spot on, however i would of liked the texture a little smoother.  It was hard to spread on the break because, well it doesn't really spread!\n\nThe Escargots were very tasty and even better when you ask for extra bread and dip it in the left over garlic pesto sauce.  \n\nI think we asked for bread 3 times, and i over heard our waiter say to another waiter, they want MORE bread???  haha. Yes we like our french bread, is that a crime?  \n\nI ordered soup du jour which happened to be cream of garlic.  Could this be a better match for me?  I happen to love garlic so of course i had to order the soup.  It was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!  I was happy to share... they gave such a huge bowl!\n\nFor my entree i decided to go with the scallops gratin which was an appetizer, but by the time this arrived, I was already so full!  The scallops were VERY flavorful.  In every bite you can taste the caramelized onion, Gruyere, Parmesan, and garlic.  You however, don't really taste the scallops at all.  This is definitely an appetizer to share.  Eating four of these bad boys will leave our mouth thirsty for water the whole night!  this is definitly my kinda dish as i love all these flavors, but maybe one would suffice! =P\n\nI tried a few of the other dishes, seared scallops ( it was very fishy and very scallopy.  I would give this dish 2 *.), steak with herbed butter ( the steak was kinda thin and tough 3*).  \n\nOverall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good.  I recommend this for those looking for a romantic restaurant at a good price ( sit outside and watch the bellagio fountain), or those with big groups looking to get a great value in Vegas!\n\nFYI Be careful of the paper covered table.  I got a huge paper cut from it!"

It was good food, but not the best salmon I've had. My husband and I shared a delicious pear ice cream parfait for dessert. And the service was superb.\n\nThe best part was watching the Bellagio fountain show from our outdoor seats. It was a lovely night and the show made it much more romantic."

  "text" : "When my party of 9 made dinner reservations for Mon Ami Gabi, we requested to be seated on the patio so we can catch a glimpse of the water show across the street at the Bellagio. Unfortunately, the desert gale force winds that night forced the patio dining area closed. The hostess was able to seat us even without the entre group present. The waiter was a great salesman. He talked the entire table into getting the raw oysters and shrimp platter to share and I'm glad he did. The raw oysters were so fresh and scrumptious that we ordered an extra plate of oysters. I had the porcini mushroom soup, which was make-you-want-to-lick-your-bowl good. \n\nHowever, that's where the positives ended. For a cocktail, I ordered their French Martini, which arrived room temperature and left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. It would have been much better chilled. For the main entrée, I had the Steak Roquefort (rare) and Frites. Firstly, the plate did not look very appetizing. It was a large, thin piece of meat with a glob of bleu cheese sauce in the middle and thinly cut fries haphazardly thrown on the side. Secondly, the meat was tough. If I had to order steak again, I would put in a few bucks more to get a real piece of meat like the Filet Mignon or the Bone-In Ribeye."

  "text" : "For a Nevadan, I really try not to visit the strip that often. Just as when I lived in San Francisco, I try not to visit the touristy spot like the Pier, or Alcatraz (truth be told, I still haven't visited Alcatraz in my 3 years in the city). When I do visit the strip, it's either CE courses or business ventures. So when a colleague insisted on dining at this restaurant, I was skeptical of the quality of food here. I'm glad they proved me wrong. \n\nHere's why I enjoyed the experience and some tips: \nThe outside dining area's view! Bellagio fountain and people watching paired with classic french cuisines and a great wine selection. Fantastic. I also love the multitude of heat lamps here because on a 55 degree night, my steak remained warm. And the steak. You have to go with the filet, rib-eye or NY strip if you want a true steak. The rest of the pretenders are pounded flat with a variety of sauces to choose from (definitely disappointing to look at). \n\nAnother disappointment is that  they don't have a classic french dish Duck Confit (fatty duck preserved in marinated duck fat, then fried up in duck fat). So this restaurant is more Gabby than Gabi which isn't bad..."

  "text" : "Mmmm...just looking at the pictures of the food we ordered still makes my tongue wag!\n\nFirst and foremost, I have got to thank all of the fellow yelpers for such an awesome find.  Everything was absolutely delish!\n\nReservations is a must for this place regardless when you eat here because it's always crowded and the wait is super duper long.  I made my reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip to Vegas for lunch at 12:30.  I have also requested outdoor patio seating but there's no guarantees with reservations, you would still have to wait.  The atrium room seating isn't bad at all.  On the afternoon that we went, it was crazy windy so trash was flying all over the place and onto people's food and into their cups. The atrium room is small but right up against the window behind the patio which if weather is permitting, you can definitely enjoy your food with the Bellagio water show without the wind or trash blowing all over the place.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  Our waitress was charming and had a great sense of humor.  She was super patient with us and accommodated us to the best that she can.  If we had questions, she answered honestly and didn't pressure us into ordering bad or pricey.\n\nFor our lunch, we ordered the French onion soup, soup du jour (parsnip and roasted garlic), porcini mushroom soup, sea scallops gratinees, steak frites with brandy peppercorn, sandwich du jour (open faced sandwich with sliced roast beef with micro greens and poached egg), and classic quiche Lorraine.  All of the food we ordered was absolutely yumm.  There is no complaint here!  We also ordered from the wine cart they have.  It's a cart filled with a selection of red and whites and you can have a mini tasting from which ever wine is being offered.  Our waitress was very generous with the pouring and for $8 per glass depending on the wine is well worth it.\n\nThis has definitely becoming a must for us everytime we play in Vegas!"

Excellent service, and our bill want that bad, considering we were eating directly on the strip.\n\nBonus: Mon Ami Gabi is part of Lettuce Entertain You's Frequent Diner program, so we got points good for another dining experience."

  "text" : "I really, REALLY wanted to give this place five stars. Maybe even more than five. But we got hit by such a huge downer at the end of the night that it killed my enthusiasm.\n\nThe boyfriend and I had been having a wonderful night, and wanted to eat somewhere good that wouldn't break the bank. We'd just finished watching the Bellagio fountains, and Mon Ami Gabi was right across the street and just what I wanted.\n\nWe sat inside, but right by the windows facing the strip and the Bellagio fountains. We got the great view without the crowd noise, smoke, and wind. Perfect atmosphere for our romantic evening.\n\nWe both went for the steak frites: steak bordelaise (red wine reduction and carmelized onions) for me, steak roquefort (blue cheese) for the boyfriend.\n\nThe original plan was for us to each eat half of out steak and switch plates. After a few bites of mine, I decided that was just not going to happen, because I liked mine too much!\n\nThe preparations were simple. Flank steak or something like that pounded thin, with the sauce or what you chose on top. Thin cut fries that I couldn't stop snacking on. It looked like too much when it got placed in front of me, but I ended up finishing it all!\n\nBut alas, our happiness couldn't last long. Our waitress was near impossible to get ahold of once the entrees were served. I wish I could give her name here, but the nametags were numbered. Not much of a name tag, I guess.\n\nI finished a few minutes before my boyfriend, and started looking around for her to get the dessert menu. I still had room for some creme brulee!\n\nFive minutes later, the boyfriend finished. I glimpsed the waitress by the bar, chatting up some other servers... and checking Facebook on her iPhone!\n\nEventually she came our way... with a large group that she started fawning all over. They ordered lots of wine, and a few appetizers. My boyfriend and I weren't quite so spendy, so maybe that's why we got put on the back burner?\n\nThis is about fifteen minutes after I finished eating, and ten since our plates had been cleared. My boyfriend and I were clearly bored and waiting, but only the bussers came by to refill our waters.\n\nAlmost twenty minutes of waiting later, the boyfriend decided that we are not asking for a dessert menu if she doesn't offer, and certainly not leaving a tip. I absolutely hate not leaving something, but I had never been so angry about service in my life so I agreed.\n\nWaitress finally comes, and offers dessert. If I didn't have a huge creme brulee craving, I would have been ready to walk. I got my dessert and my boyfriend got Bananas Foster.\n\nMy dessert was good, but it's not like you can mess up creme brulee. My boyfriend's dessert was huge, but he said it could have used more bananas. Still, he cleared his plate.\n\nWe booked it as soon as she got us our check. We had really been having a wonderful evening, one I won't forget, but the horrible service left a bad taste in my mouth. I really hope it's an anomaly, because I may come here again my next trip to Vegas."

To start their dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives are to die for, best I have had at any place. I have eaten here twice, most recently I had the New York Strip with peppercorn sauce and can I say WOW! Have the French onion soup to start and your meal is complete. Great service, great food! \n\nSo why don't I give this a 5 you ask? Despite having reservation we had to wait a while to be seated, but hey, I was patient."

  "text" : "Ah, Mon Ami Gabi. What can I say?  Well let's see..................\n\nMon Ami Gabi is our go to restaurant whenever any friends or family from out of town show up on our doorstep.  The food is always excellent, the service for the most part is always top rate and mostly it is the French Vibe the place gives off. If however, French Vibes are not your thing, go for the food anyway. \n\nThe restaurant consists of basically 3 rooms. The back room is a bit on the dark side where you can imagine Victor Hugo sitting and enjoying a glass of Absinthe (sorry, not available here) and writing his next great masterpiece. The front room is very light and airy where you can imagine Truffault and Deneauve discussing their next cinematic project  over an amusing Beaujolais. The best of the three is the outdoor patio, which has to be the best patio dining in Las Vegas. Pure Paris.....Fresh air, the fountains of Bellagio with music across the street and a constant stream of people to observe and try and figure out.  Be warned that no reservations are accepted for the patio, so a brief wait may be in store, but if time is important you can reserve a table indoors.\n\nFood, Oh yes.............They do serve it. \n\nYou can not go wrong with any of the 3 Steak Frites versions. The French onion soup is to die for as are the Scallops.  Salads and Quiches are also excellent , and any of the desserts will please. They have quite an extensive Wine List, but if You ask for the House Wine which is kind of hidden on the list You will get a Bottle from Louis Latour or George Duboeuf depending on your preference.\n\nWe were there on opening day and I can't even count how many times since. By Las Vegas prices, it is a place you can bring company to and still have a couple of bucks left to try your luck in the casino. Bon Appetite."

  "text" : "Yum, yum, yum. \n\nIt was a gorgeous day last Monday when I was on the strip, so my friend and I decided to look for a place to have lunch outside. Mon Ami Gabi looked happening, so we popped into the Paris and added our name to the list. Our wait was supposed to be 35 minutes for a patio seat, but really it turned out to be more like 15. \n\nThe hostess told me she didn't want to be at work as she was walking us to our table, which I thought was a little odd, but I couldn't blame her. It was a beautiful day. Our waiter was on-point. He was attentive but not over-bearing. \n\nThe French bread came out hot and delicious. And the butter was room temperature - something that is key and that most places don't do. Split the loaf with my friend and had a happy start to the meal.\n\nThe menu had lots of delicious-sounding options, but I settled on the seafood crepe while my friend ordered the open-face shrimp salad sandwich with avocado. When our food came out, my friend and I switched. She hates celery and there was a lot of it in this shrimp salad. There was also a lot of shrimp and red pepper. Yum. And it wasn't too mayonnaise-y. I thought the bread under the salad was a little useless, since it got soggy, and the giant lettuce pieces were a little difficult to eat. I also didn't quite see how the avocado fit in, but I was happy to eat it. Overall, I found it yummy. The fries it came with were more like potato crisps (like the chips in the grocery store). So-so, but nothing I'd munch on regularly.\n\nWhat was even yummier, though, was that seafood crepe. Holy moly. The scallops were perfect - buttery, charred on one side, and just yum. The shrimp were also grilled yumminess. There was a fair portion of seafood on the crepe. The sauce really made the dish, though. I can't even describe it other than yum, heaven, something I'd like to drink from a glass. It was thick-ish and buttery. And the peas were a perfect touch. The only complaint: The menu said the crepe came with a salad. It was more like 3 pieces of lettuce tucked on the side of the plate.\n\nMy friend is huge on dessert, so she ordered the profiterole trio. The caramel ice cream was delicious. The vanilla and chocolate were also good. The fudge sauce drizzled over the dish was heaven. And the profiteroles/pastries were airy, crisp and yummy.\n\nI thought the lunch prices were really reasonable for Vegas. $12 for the shrimp salad and $15-17 for the crepe. \n\nThe view of the Bellagio water show made this lunch even better."

There's lots of indoor seating, but the best place to sit is outside.  Fresh air, people-watching and a great view of the Bellagio and the water show!\n\nI came for Sunday brunch and got a table outside.  I had a delicious blueberry waffle topped with lots of fresh blueberries with warm blueberry syrup and whipped cream on the side.  I added a side of the crispiest bacon I've ever had.  Seriously, be careful if your teeth are prone to chipping.  The bacon is also sweet, so not tops in my book but good for those of you who like it that way.  No mimosas or bloody marys for me, but I did have a cappuccino and a cafe latte.  Both were good, but maybe a tad on the weaker side.  I mean I had no caffeine high at all!\n\nI heard the steak is amazing here so I'll have to come back for dinner sometime."

Both were delicious, and the fruit tray had some of the best cantaloupe I've eaten in recent memory.

We ended up getting out to eat on the patio, no problem. It was rather crowded, but we still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains. They also have heat lamps, which made it cozy since it was a little chilly outside.\n\nI love bread so much that sometimes I fill up on it before my entree comes out. It was very difficult not to do that with Mon Ami Gabi's bread! The bread was delicious, and the butter was AMAZING. I said to my husband, \"This is like...super butter.\" Very very buttery and yummy. Phenomenal.\n\nI selected the skate fish for my entree and my husband selected the beef bourguinon. I thought the skate was very good - well prepared and light. The beef bourguinon was INCREDIBLE, though. Tender beef that must have simmered in the sauce for 12 hours. Rich and delicious.\n\nWe were stuffed by the time dessert came around. Looking back, we really didn't eat a lot - we didn't get any appetizers or dessert, but it remains one of the most satisfying meals I've had. The service was outstanding, as well."

The scallops were very flavorful, but a bit overcooked (still great). The steak was a bit too thin and the fries a little too salty, but also both were good. We also tried the french onion soup, which was delicious. It's one of the best that I've ever had.\n\nThe service was great and the prices were reasonable.

I had the steak classic for a change from the filet, and it was much tastier than I expected.

Our friends work at Paris and are regulars of Mon Ami Gabi, but it was a first time experience for me and my boyfriend. \nTo start out, the view is great! Even though I work at the Bellagio, I never really get to view the fountain show from across the street. Everyone made me choose the bottle of wine for the table for some strange reason, and although my wine knowledge is limited I went with a 2005 Bordeaux blend and everyone loved it. \nWe started out with a couple appetizers to share and let me tell you how seriously delicious the escargot was! They were oven roasted in a garlic herb butter and just melt in your mouth. We also tried (much to my hesitation) the chicken liver mousse and I don't know much about pate or liver (except that mine is probably mad at me), but it had such an incredible flavor. They brought complimentary warm rosemary seasoned olives to the table, and if I weren't so excited about filet mignon, I would have been completely satisfied right then and there.\nBut, then came my perfectly cooked medium rare filet mignon drizzled with a merlot butter and I was the happiest girl in the world! \nI reluctantly shared half of my steak with my boyfriend, but we both decided that next time we will come hungrier and get out own cuts. Our server was great and so knowledgeable about every little detail.We finished the night with after-dinner drinks and good conversation. I slept so well last night :)"

We said that's ok, we can sit inside, so we were seated right away.  They walked us all the way close to the patio where the cover was.  That was pretty good too.  We were surprised that we got to sit there.  You don't get the outside breeze that day and you get all the natural sun light.  GF had the salad and the soup of the day.  I had the escargot and sliced duck sandwich special.  Soup of the day wasn't great, but my escargot and sandwich was great.  Service again was good too.  If you can get there early to outside seating during the summer, you should do it.  That day was pretty windy, so we made the right choice by sitting inside."

We were inside, close to the patio doors, and the weather outside kept us from enjoying our meal. Service was fairly good, although we were amused by out waitress constantly touching someone in our party every time she came by. Apparently she read that if you touch your patron they'd tip more, but since she didn't know who was going to pay the bill she wasn't going to take any chances so she touched us all."

I feel like someone should throw some confetti on me!\n\nMon Ami Gabi is originally from Chicago and was really excited when they built a location here on the Strip.  Over the years I have dragged my of my co-workers from around the world to this place and it is not uncommon for use to eat here several times during a business trip.  The food, service and drinks are just amazing.  This is one of the best thinly pounded steaks you can get anywhere.  I like the one topped with blue cheese, in fact I do not even look at the menu anymore.  Just bring it to me Medium Rare...in fact I have gotten my steak within 5 minutes of ordering...they are that fast.  Chef Ramsey would not have to worry about pushing out orders here.\n\nOther benefits of this location.  The outdoor patio on the Strip is just amazing with views of the Dancing water show at the Bellagio.  There are no reservations taken for seating here, so come early or late or just wait!  \n\nWhen I come here by myself I like to eat at the bar...there are two bars...one in front and one right by the outdoor patio.  I feel like a regular here because the bartenders have gotten to know me over the years...makes me feel like home but I do not even live here.  Speaking of the bar...make sure you get your martini's with the blue cheese stuffed olives...so good!  But be careful because people at your table will steal them.\n\nWe tried something new here this week for desert...the white chocolate bread pudding...it was so yummy...I have never liked bread pudding but this was out of this world.\n\nEverything about this place makes this the best restaurant in Las Vegas!"

  "text" : "This was a perfect spot for dinner before a show on Saturday night.  We had a 7pm reservation, and had to wait a few minutes while they caught up, but we were in and out within an hour.  The decor was very understated...I can't say that it resembled Paris, but it looked like a nice New York steakhouse in the early 20th century (in my imagination, anyway).  Sadly, we could not see the Bellagio fountain from our seat inside the restaurant, despite asking for it on our www.opentable.com reservation.  But our experience was otherwise very positive.\n\nWine by the glass was reasonably priced, and earned a hefty pour.  The bottles were familiar favorites, well chosen.  The menu is very traditional - your steak house usual suspects.  We both got the filet mignon, so I cannot speak to their standard steaks.   The filets were more than 8oz each, and perfectly cooked (my medium rare was like butter).  The hubby got his with bleu cheese - I order with the merlot butter.  Both were delicious, perfectly seasoned options.  The steaks themselves were unadulterated.  The fries were nearly flat - somewhere between a potato chip and a fry, as other reviewers have commented.  I personally loved them (and you get a ton), but I suppose it's a matter of taste.  They were very crispy, and not at all oily.  Give 'em a shot!  We also got an order of green beans, which my husband totally ignored, but were perfectly cooked and an excellent vegetable accompaniment.  Bread was lovely and warm, and served in a paper bag with butter and some sort of slaw that we overlooked.  It was OK (the slaw, that is).\n\nOur waiter was extremely efficient and still affable, though not terribly friendly.  He was kind enough to take a photo for us, and made sure we were comfortable.  The people next to us were very odd, and one appeared to be obscenely drunk, but hey - it's Vegas.  Had they had a few more vegetable sides available, and perhaps a few original steak preparations, I would have given them 5 stars easily.  As it was, Mon Ami Gabi gets my full recommendation, and though Las Vegas is full of tasty restaurants, this reasonably priced and delicious steakhouse gets an honorable mention in my book."

The drinks were great (everything's better with a little champagne!), although they did take awhile to get out to us. Our lunches were both devoured, a chicken blt and shrimp open face sandwich, both with frittes. They could have only given us one serving of the frittes cause they were HUGE and not really my fave anyways. Our server was overall pretty slow, but the rest of the experience made up for it. Not really that pricy all things considered either."

On Friday night, it was Dover Sole with a light lemon, caper, butter sauce, served over slighted wilted spinach and with a side of mini roasted red potatoes. \n\nThe place smacks me from the sidewalk as a tourist trap. It's located right across the street from the Bellagio fountains, the outdoor patio is situated right on the sidewalk, and it's a giant space. However, the food is amazing, and it rightly deserves the number of stars that 500+ people have given. \n\nPlan ahead if you're able to.

A better location for viewing the fountains would be floating above the sidewalk, but I think that's about it!  We had reservations, but forgot to specifically ask for a patio table.

That would include: \n\nPitcher of \"Fran\"gria\n\nAppetizers (to share):\nhalf dozen oysters- come with shallots in vinegar, lemon, and cocktail sauce.  a bit on the small size, but perfectly delicious\nhomemade potato chips (I forget the fancy name) -so good.\nthree cheese plate- delectable.  we also went through five or six of their demi baguettes....\n\nIndividual Entree:\nI got the scallops and they were DIVINE.

I was skeptical, but his stomach has good taste, so I went along.\n\nWe got there around 10:15am and was told we'd have a 30 minute wait, which meant they couldn't guarantee us the breakfast menu (which ends at 11am). Poo. He really wanted the eggs benedict.\n\nBUT we were seated in about 15 minutes in a cozy little corner of the patio. Our server promptly got our drink orders (coffee for me and mimosas for both). She took our orders and didn't even flinched when the BF asked for smoked salmon in his eggs and I replaced the turkey in my omelette with mushrooms. \n\nThe omelette was AMAZING! They put chives and cilantro on it which gave it an extra kick and made it tastier than I could've possible imagined up myself. Apparently the BF's eggs were so good he polished off his entire plate (what a fatty =P). \n\nTo top it off, the waitress gladly gave me a to go cup of a refill of coffee to send us on our way.\n\nGreat food, perfect service.. this place definitely deserves 5 stars!!"

The food came quick, but not too quick (didn't feel rushed), and the environment was fun, casual, but classy as well. \n\nI would recommend Mon Ami Gabi for dates, good food, birthdays, or if you just want a classy meal. \n\nI also love that the restaurant is located across from the Bellagio and if you sit outside you have an incredible view of the water show. \n\nEnjoy!

  "text" : "Believe it or not, my friends and I got a recommendation for Mon Ami Gabi from our cab driver! On our cab ride from the airport to the hotel, the cab driver was giving us a song and dance about being able to get us into the clubs, so while he was on a roll, my friend asked him where he would recommend to eat. It was interesting to hear what he said even though we had all been to Vegas before.\n\nAm I glad we listened to him! He told us to check out Mon Ami Gabi around 2:30pm for lunch in order to catch the 3pm fountain show at the Bellagio. We went on Sunday around 2:15pm and asked for a table outside on the rail (like the cabbie told us to ask for). They told us it would be a 45 minute wait especially for a table outside. But it turned into more like 30 minutes. We killed time at the casino ; ) \n\nEverything was perfect, except that is was SOOOO sunny and hot on this particular day, so we ended up rushing through our meal due to the fact that the seats \"on the rail\" have to cover above. Even with that, the service was perfect, the waitress was polite and fast and the food...was AMAZING. Two of us got the same sandwich special and my other friend got one of the club sandwiches. We all liked our food. Yum! The sandwich I had was chicken with pesto, grilled red peppers and yummy cheezy-ness! YUM!\n\nThe lunch prices were surprisingly reasonable for such good service and food, $9-$15! Seeing (and hearing) the Bellagio water show was so fun!\n\nMy recommendation is:\n1) During the day, ask to sit outside, but under and umbrella!\nOr\n2) Go for a super late lunch or early dinner when the sun is lower in the sky or dark : ) It must be beautiful then!\n\nHighly recommend it, but if you need a very specific time, call ahead and make a reservation so you get to see the show! Check out times here:\n\nMonday - Friday\n3:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1/2 hour\n8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes\n\nSaturdays, Sundays and Holidays\n12:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1/2 hour\n8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes"

  "text" : "Had lunch twice while on a weekend business trip. I wished I would have had all my meals here. Although not perfect, they do a fantastic job in a very busy mileu. Day one I had the French Onion soup, my personal benchmark for a restaurant. Wow. The portion was generous, the gruyere delicious and the soup itself richly flavored without being salty (are you listening Thomas Keller?) The french bread was likewise great. The signature steak frites was tasty, though the very thin cut made my rare order somewhat relative. I ate almost all of the frites (french fries) at great risk to my cardiovascular health. Although I was not remotely hungry afterwards, I ordered the bread pudding. It was a little non-traditional, more like a sponge cake with caramel sauce , but excellent for what it was. I came back the next day and brought a friend. The sole special was past its freshness peak and my artichoke soup could have been warmer. Had I had more time I would have sent it back, but such was not the case. My lunch partner was pleased with his beef sandwich. Finally, the waitstaff was great, very friendly and efficient. There are a number of secondary dining room managers on the prowl also keeping things running smooth. The only other place I have had this level of service recently was in the Brennan family restaurants in New Orleans."

We celebrated a birthday here with a group of 6 people and we had made reservations and were lucky enough to have it near enough the patio that we were able to view the Bellagio water show during dinner!\n\nThe girls started out with a martini that had grey goose and champagne and I think something else too which was really good! \n\nThe escargot was delicious!  It was in a pesto sauce which can out nice and hot!  The brie and garlic starter was also very delicious and it was really good with the fresh baguettes they had as well!  \n\nI had the rib eye and lots of different sides and everything was good! I love to eat my meat medium rare and it's hard to find places that actually make it medium rare! It's always more medium than it is rare but Mon Ami Gabi did a great job!

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is my all-time favorite restaurant in the world.  I'm from Los Angeles, so visits to Las Vegas are quite frequent for me.  Although the glitz and glam of Vegas have attracted some of the world's top chefs, I'm sure none of them expected to be beat by a chain restaurant like Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nThe service at Mon Ami is incredibly great.  Of all the times that I've dined here, about 95% of my visits were great.  The food, the wait staff (Angie & Misty, love ya babes) and their bartender (Rick) are some of the most pleasant to have serving you.\n\nMy recommendations for this restaurant are the following\nAppetizer: Escargots (The best I've ever had)\nEntree: Filet Mignot w/ Merlot Butter (Done Blue or Rare)\nDessert: Flourless Chocolate Cake (One of a kind)\n\nIf you're not daring enough for snails, I'd recommend the Shrimp Gabi.  Also, if the Flourless Chocolate Cake is not available, I'd recommend their Bread Pudding in it's place.\n\nDrink Recommendations\nMen: Orange Whip (Only Available Here @ Mon Ami Gabi)\nWomen: Paris Romance (Only Available Here @ Mon Ami Gabi)\n\nGoing beyond the great food and excellent service, my favorite part of my dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi is recieving the bill.  With an appetizer, entree, desert, and drink on my tab, I was surprised to find my final payment with a 20% tip to be only two digits.\n\nGreat food, great service, great price.  What more could you ask for?\n\nOh yeah that's right, the setting.  If you're seated indoors, you'll be dining under a very dimmly lit dinning hall with 50 foot ceilings.  Yes, it is that high and no I am not exaggerating.  If you're dinning outdoors (my favorite) you will not only be enjoying great food with a great wait staff but you will also be entertained every fifteen minutes by the fountains of Bellagio, directly across the street.\n\nGreat food, great service, great price, great setting.\n\nWhat more could you ask for?"

Both were excellent.  I also had a ginger peach hot tea that smelled lovely and was very flavorful.  Our server was very fast even though the place was packed, so I was pretty impressed.  When I'm in Vegas again, I'll probably be heading here for breakfast."

Mon Ami Gabi is located within the Paris Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAs a first time visitor, I had no expectations.  The service, cocktails, appetizers, entree and desert were all superb...  YES... I did say we ate a full course meal!!! LOL\n\nI can't remember the entire menu, but I started with a champagne + grey goose martini, followed by sauteed scallops (appetizer) and the most remarkable tilapia ever.  Who said you should not order seafood at a steakhouse?  I would usually agree, but not for Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nTo top off the evening, my girlfriend ordered creme brulee with an additional spoon... I totally indulged.\n\nDon't miss this treat... Mon Ami Gabi is LP Certified...\n\nXoXo"

We had reservations for noon but because we wanted to sit on the patio, it took an extra 15 minutes or so for a table. I highly suggest waiting for it though. It's a perfect place to rock them loccs or douche bag sunglasses while people watching and enjoying the water show across the way at Bellagio.\n\nI had the French Toast ($11) which was topped with whipped cream and blueberries. Man was this entree' dank! The French Toast was made to perfection and the blueberries definitely complimented it. I may have to go out on a limb here and say it's one of the best French Toasts I have ever grubbed on.\n\nI also sampled the Jumbo Crab Cakes ($15) which I thought was very rich but still very well made. It's not an over whelming dish. Perhaps sharing it as an appetizer would be a good idea.\n\nI didn't sample my other table mate's dishes but I can say that everyone in my party had positive reviews. All of us agreed that everything we ordered was awesome. No complaints on that day.\n\nWith all the many years I have been coming to Sin City, I can't believe I have barely experienced Mon Ami Gabi for the first time. I feel somewhat shameful. I've seriously been missing out on some great and affordable French food. I can't comment on their dinner yet but perhaps next time under them city lights. \n\nAu Revoir!"

Gabi enticed me when I was being driven down the strip and saw the hoards of tourists having a fling with him. Even though we hadn't met yet, the flames of jealousy were already being fanned. Gabi, stood at the bottom of the Eiffel tower replica...what a romantic Gabi is! He's a wanted man so if you want to hang with Gabi and avert your gaze at the Bellagio fountains...remember to call in advance to reserve your spot. The wait can be as long at 2 hours on some nights. Gabi will also let you dine inside, but the magic is lost without the blistering heat of Vegas and cooling views of the fountains. \n\nHow does Gabi rank in his culinary skills? For French cuisine, Gabi is absolutely fantastic. His steak is pounded thin cooked to preference, his frites are unique, thin strips strings. They are addicting and keep you wanting more. His scallops are mediocre at best but simple if you just want something light. The accompanying cauliflower puree is a great substitute for mashed potatoes.\n\nGabi, I count the days until our next encounter. You are the best friend with benefits I've ever had...you have stolen my stomach."

I had to call and push it back thanks to LV Blvd's crappy traffic and the people were very kind and changed it for us.  When we got there we circumvented a 1 hour wait thanks to the reservation and were seated promptly.\n\nWe started off with a warm olive jar and some warm bread which was amazing in my opinion (but I'm a huge olive buff so I think I enjoyed it more than my wife).\n\nNow for the bad things...\n\nThey screwed up my wife's drink order and MY drink (the Frangria) was a funky version of the classic sangria which ironically I love.  How they butchered it is beyond me.\n\nI ordered the 3 cheese plate with a side of garlic spinach since I saw some other guy recommend it on here.  Both...were...utter...crap.  The cheese plate was some $15 and included a tablespoon amount of Bluecheese, Brie, and some herb-laden cheese that I am unfamiliar with (oh btw, these are conclusions I've deduced, the waitress didn't bother to enlighten me to what the \"chef's choice\" actually was).  The spinach I had high hopes for and it failed me badly.  I personally love spinach, and i love garlic...but apparently the two together are a poor match.  It was barely edible w/out coupling it with bites of the steak that my poor wife offered me.\n\nBill ran over $100 for a place that was allegedly a \"$$\" restaurant.  I hate to say it but I wouldn't recommend Mon Ami Gabi to the casual or the curious."

I made reservations over a month ago, just to make sure I got a tableau before the Memorial Day crowds overtook Vegas. Be aware that they do not take reservations for the outside patio and it is a separate waiting list. \n\nWe waited less than 5 minutes for an outside table. The view of the Bellagio fountains and the people-watching on the Strip could not have been better. \n\nThe Steak Classique was really delicious. I was surprised by how tender the steak was. The pommes frites were cooked to crispy perfection. \n\nMake sure you save room for dessert. I complained to my bf about how I hadn't had a good creme brulee all week.

Perfectly cooked and dripping in that delicious butter, it was one of, if not the, best steak I've ever had. The frites that it comes with were a pleasant surprise. I was expecting something more like steak fries, which I'm not a HUGE fan of, and the crispy delicious little potato ribbons got even better when dragged through some of the extra merlot butter. \n\nFor dessert we split creme brulee and bananas foster crepes. I don't eat bananas, but everyone else said they were super tasty, and the creme brulee was silky and not too sweet. Loved it.\n\nService was friendly and efficient without being obtrusive. And for the quality of the service and food, and that the restaurant is right on the strip, it really wasn't that expensive. I'd highly recommend it!"

The location is obviously a great plus, with its view of the Bellagio fountain and people watching. Though the Vegas heat was at an oppressive 100+ degrees, the misters and umbrellas did a decent job keeping us from overheating. The bread is phenomenal. Our appetizers were great. But the dishes we paid the most for ended up being the most underwhelming. \n\nThe appetizers that were a hit were the oysters, which were plump, fresh, and super refreshing, and the moules frites, though, I give more credit to the bread for that as it was the main vehicle in which we enjoyed the moules frites since the fries were just so-so. \n\nThe seared tuna salad is definitely one to avoid. The seafood crepe had great scallops on the plate, but the shrimp tough and extremely overcooked. The best of the entrees was the open faced crab salad sandwich which was great for such a hot day, and unlike the seared tuna salad, seasoned well. I got sweetness from the crab, creaminess from the avocado, and bite from the thousand island dressing that boasted some really delicious chopped cornichons. \n\n$50 per person and we had drinks (iced tea and french 75s)."

We were in and out in 45 minutes having eaten bread, appetizers, and our main courses, and a whole carafe of frangria.  Service was great though, but it seemed as soon as we ordered our food and our waitress put it in the computer, it was on our tables!  \n\nStarted with the Petite Salad- Olive vinagrette had great flavor and just enough olive to be good, without being overbearing.  Friend had the Onion Soup- he loved it so much he did not share!  The soup was more the size of a super tall crock with cheese dripping down the sides, just crisp enough (the best part!)\n\nMain course- Steak Classique.  Huge piece of steak, and lots of butter flavor.  I was worried the steak may be lower quality based on the price, but it was actually very good, not tough, and easy to eat!   Friend had the Au Poivre, and liked his flavor, though he had a bit more fat on his steak than me (lucky me!)\n\nDefinitly get the Frangria (it is just like Sangria)!  It was cheapish for Vegas, and a hugh carafe of yummy wine mixed with fresh fruits.\n\nMon Ami Gabi is a good LV stand by- nice steak meal without paying an arm and a leg.  One point of advice- maybe order your appetizer and wait to order your main course if you do not want the meal to fly by too fast!"

If I don't make it to this great place at least 3 times a year, something is seriously wrong. \n\nLet me summarize the main reasons why this eatery should be on your list of places to try while in Vegas (and if you live here, why it should be in your top 5)\n\nThe food, service, and decor are a much higher standard than the price point. Sure- you can get impeccable 3 course meal, 5 star service , and white table cloth upscale dining elsewhere, but can you think of a place where you can get all three for less than $50 a person? I know of only two other places in Vegas that give you this level of value, and they only do it for lunch and one is hit or miss on the quality.  \nThe steaks. As a foodie and self proclaimed grill god, I make my own at home, with only one exception- Mon Ami Gabi. It 's the sauces and fries that keep me coming back. \nEveryone loves the atmosphere!

She actually wanted to get to know us! \n\nWe had the quiche lorraine. OMG! This was one of the best quiches I have ever had! It wasn't a slice but it was the whole pie! It was very good sized and the crust was so flaky. The egg wasn't overpowering and had great flavor. The good thing I like about this was that the bacon was thick cut! *drools* Around $12.00\n\nThe crab salad was allright. It was served open faced or with one piece of bread. It tasted fresh but wasn't anything super duper special. Real crab thou. Around $14.00\n\nThe bread they give you in the beginning is really cute. It comes wrapped in Mon Ami Gabi paper and is a delicious fresh baked french baguette. \n\nGreat view of the Bellagio and you can people watch! Around $30 for 2 people for lunch not too bad at all."

We approached the hostess stand, and asked to be seated at a table for two on the patio. It was 3:45, yet the hostess grabbed two dinner menu's. When we inquired as to when they stopped serving lunch, we were told that dinner began at 4. The hostess, a napoleon complexed girl who was evidently severely jaded about her job, proceeded to lead us outside past a dozen empty tables to one far out of the way around the side... with a view of the facade of the building. Perfect. \n\nWe asked if we could be seated at a table nearer the front of the patio, as we had wanted to catch the Bellagio Fountains before we left. She scowled, looked around, and said that was all she had. A basic 'screw you all, I will seat you where I want'. Again, we politely pointed out that there were many empty tables scattered throughout the patio, many of which were in the desirable location of the front. Nope. She was having none of it, and basically said that the table she was offering us near the emergency exit in the very far end/back of the patio was the only place we were welcome to dine. \n\nEnough of that, we decided at that point that dining there was not worth any amount of 'service' she or the waitstaff could provide. We left, without so much as sitting down. \n\nSo perhaps the food at Mon Ami Gabi is decent, or even great... However due to a profusely incompetent hostess I did not have the opportunity to give this restaurant a chance."

Still, after narrowing down what we wanted to eat, here we ended up. \n\nService was fine, though I almost felt bad leaving the tip for the waiter when I felt like we saw the bus boy more. We were seated quickly (Tuesday night), and there was a 45 minute wait for the patio. Though it was one of the reasons I got the recommendation, we were way too hungry to wait (and we only had 24 hours in Vegas people!!), but lucky to get a table right away just inside the patio. \n\nFood was good, and the portions were very generous. We were brought bread with butter and a little dish of carrot slaw--deeee-licious! We both ordered the soup du jour which was a potato leek vichyssoise, also outstanding. I was a little surprised at the cut of my steak (I was expecting more of a sirloin type piece, but got what looked like hangar or skirt), but it was cooked well and the au poivre sauce was flavorful. The frites were very thin and crispy to the point of not really tasting like potatoes anymore.\n\nBack to the aforementioned patio: Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Casino, directly across the strip from the Bellagio fountains, which makes it's patio so popular. Since we had a window seat, though we couldn't hear the music, we could still see the fountains which made the dining experience very memorable. If you can't wait for the patio, definitely ask for a table inside it."

My husband  had the filet mignon and thought it tasted like it had been previously frozen. The service was a little slow but friendly. The atmosphere was very nice. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience especially considering how expensive it was."

Plus, the views from the patio is of the Bellagio water show every 20 minutes or so.\n\nWe started with our usual Escargot appetizer and it is great paired with the french bread at your table.  Buttery pesto garlic deliciousness.\n\nI am simple at M.A.G.  I've been so many times, I've honed in on one item - the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter.  The meat is so soft, you swear you can cut it with a fork.  And the flavors are off the charts.\n\nI was too full to attempt dessert.  But I've had it before and it does not fail.\n\nI'm a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi.  It is a great place for a fancy dinner, or a dinner meeting, or just to eat and people watch the freaks in Vegas make their way down the strip."

Our server made sure we didn't pour our carafe of Frangria (reallliee good) ourselves :D  Great view, service, price, & food!!!\n\nOn to the foodies we had:\n\n*Mussels Marinière* --  Absolutely deee-lishcious!!!  Best mussels dish I've yet had in Vegas. To savor it all (down to the last few drips of sauce) we dipped the remaining of our fresh baguette into their white wine & herb sauce. Yuumm!! \n\n*Seafood Crepe* -- Excellent dish! Nice sized scallops & shrimps - perfectly cooked. Best eaten when served fresh out from the kitchen.\n\n*Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad* -- The blueberries & walnuts went so well with this salad! Big portion salmon - flavorful, not dry & grilled just right on a semi warm bed of spinich.\n\n\nHELLSYA i'll be returning to dine at this place again... well the next time i'm out here for Vegas~!  ^^;"

  "text" : "Having done Vegas (at least once) every year for the past few years, it's nice to finally find a restaurant that is not overpriced, doesn't make you feel super-touristy (even while you're eating right on the strip), and has decent food.  Based on the food, I would give it more like a 3.5 stars but I'm going to round it up for pricing and service.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say the service was wonderful - never rushed and the food coming in at perfect intervals.  By some stroke of bon fortuna, my sister and I were seated immediately on the patio even though it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was already packed to the max with diners.  Once seated, we were served our waters almost immediately and given our very own small baguette.  The baguette was good, but the complimentary creamy carrot-based dipping sauce it came with was perfection!  I hope they put that on their regular menu because I would pay for that.\n\nOur waiter took our orders pretty promptly which gave us enough time to sit and relax and watch the Bellagio fountain show before our app showed up.  We had the escargot to start off with.  They serve you 6 of these bad boys, already de-shelled and therefore not so intimidating for first-timers like us.  They were absolutely delicious - covered in enough butter and garlic and herbs to make you forget you were eating a snail.  \n\nTheir fish is supposed to be fresh everyday which is always a plus for this Californian.  So for our main course, I ordered the skate and my sister had the trout.  The skate was too salty, but had a decent amount of butter to keep it edible.  Skate is pretty tasty on its own so I wasn't sure why they had to drench that thing with so much salt.  The fancy garlic potato chips and mixed veggie accompaniment were very good however.  My sister's trout was exactly what I expected it to taste like - which is to say it tasted more like trout with butter and lemon and less like a salty hot mess like mine did.  \n\nThe total bill came out to, what?  $55?  Wow, you can eat good food for a good price on the strip!  Overall, the food had some highs and lows but the service along with the beautiful views were enough to make for the beginning of a good night in Vegas."

  "text" : "I was out and about this past weekend, photowalking with a friend down The Strip with the Paris being our first stop.  It was roughly 4:00pm or so when our stomachs began to speak to us.  A quiet stomach is usually a happy one, and mine was getting ready to tell me off for not feeding it.  \n\nMy friend said that steak frites makes for a good dish; me being fairly unexposed to French Cuisine, I learn that it's a common dish consisting of a steak and fries.  I like steak, and I love potatoes, so this sounded like a winning combination to me.  \n\nWe wandered through the Paris and looked at the menus of the different restaurants and cafes; surprisingly, the price for steak frites appeared to be cheapest at Mon Ami Gabi!  The other cafes offered steak frites for about $3 to $4 more than Mon Ami Gabi's offering.\n\nSo after deciding, my friend and I enter Mon Ami and are seated quickly, indoors just as we asked.  Water was brought to our table, and we were asked if we knew what we wanted.  It's hard to know what I want when we've been seated for less than two minutes...but okay.  We ask for a few more minutes, and the waitress then explains the day's specials.  My friend and I haven't even ordered yet and we both get the feeling that our server is either having a bad day, or doesn't want to work there.  The next time she comes by, we order the Steak Bearnaise ($23.95), a steak frites dish serve with bearnaise sauce.  While waiting for our dish we enjoy ourselves some french bread and butter.\n\nWhen the food came, the dish was exactly what my friend had explained: steak and fries!  The steak was a thin strip of meat that we had cooked medium.  Fries were thin, crispy, and barely salted.  It made for a very pleasing side to the steak.  The bearnaise sauce was thick enough to coat either the steak or fries when dipped, but thin enough to start dripping off your food if you didn't eat it right away.  A nice buttery consistency and flavor, with hints of white wine possibly.  \n\nThe food was good; something I'd travel back to the Paris for?  Not really.  My rating above is a reflection of the service my friend and I experienced.  We were visited by our server a total of four times during our meal: to bring us water, to take our order, to take our dishes away and to drop off the check.  No asking how the food was, refills on our water, not even stopping by to see how things were after making eye contact with the server.  We didn't feel welcomed, we felt like a burden to the server.  This didn't feel like a French restaurant on the strip, this felt like a bad night at Applebees.  And that's not a hit to Applebees; I'm satisfied with the service at Applebees."

  "text" : "Hands down, one of the best meals of life (...and I've had a lot of damn good meals)....\nWe made a reservation at Mon Ami Gabi for dinner on the 4th of July. We sat inside and were waited on my Michelle, who was outstanding. When we got to the table they brought us an amuse bouche of orzo salad (yum) and their french bread...warm, crusty, oh-so-satisfying.\nWe started our meal with a few drinks and also ordered the baked cheese. So, so good....I am craving it right now. It's basically a mixture of soft cheeses (cream cheese, goat cheese, etc.) that are baked in the oven, mixed with fresh marinara sauce, and served with toasted french bread drizzled in basil garlic oil. There were only two of us and we basically licked the bowl clean...it was that good.\nFor our meals we both got the signature filet mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. I got the asparagus for my side and my friend got the fries. The portions were surprisingly large and the meat was impeccably cooked. The filet was soft and well seasoned....melted in my mouth. Without a doubt, the best steak I have ever had (and funnily enough also one of the cheapest). The asparagus was fresh and delicious. I also stole quite a few fries from across the table...those things are addictive. \nWe ended the meal with creme brulee. The custard was sweet and creamy and rich....exactly what I wanted. \nOverall, a fantastic meal. I couldn't pick out a single flaw (and I can almost always pinpoint more than one). During our meal I looked around the nearby tables and picked up on a few conversations, and everyone was commenting on how spectacular the food and service were...lots of happy people and bellies. I will come here time and time again. Wonderful meal, wonderful waitress, and a price that honestly can't be beat. My new \"to go to\" place in Vegas."

But then, this place really needs no excuse for me to dine...\n\nThe staff here are super friendly and courteous, and very efficient. Our waitress was easy to chat with, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered even our silly questions about the humongous wine bottles decorating the restaurant. She was very on top of everything, checking periodically to make sure everything was to our liking while my friends and I dined.\n\nBetween all 4 of us, we ordered the BLT sandwich, seafood crepe, chicken crepe, and the sandwich of the day - lamb burger stuffed with roquefort cheese. The 2 sandwiches came with waffle fries and regular fries respectively. However, their fries are very different, as they are cut super super thin, so it's like eating potato chips instead of french fries. I loved this, but my friend was not quite as fond of it. We all liked our main dish though, so that was alright =). My lamb burger was juicy and oh-so-delish. The roquefort was just such yummy goodness and a perfect complement to the lamb, which was cook to a perfect medium-rare just as I requested. I can't tell you how happy that makes me when a restaurant can fulfill such a simple request such as this. You would think the request is simple but you will be amazed how many places always get it wrong.\n\nThe ambiance is very relaxing and chic, posh without being pretentious. It was a lovely experience and I can't wait to go back again!"

  "text" : "Great environment. Great Food. Great Service! \n\nMy gf and I were running late so we extended our reservation and gladly they were able to do so. In the end, we were still very late (we had to walk from aria to take the tram from city center to get bellagio then walk over to paris).  For a sec, I thought we would have to wait in line for our table and then we would have to run to MGM to catch our show @ 930. But turns out, our table was still there and it was a pretty good spot (right next to the window). So we didn't have to sit outside and deal with heat, but at the same time we were able to see the fountains at Bellagio. \n\nFood wise. We decided to go with seafood because we had enough of buffets and steaks. We ordered 3 dishes: Mussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs), Escargots, Seared Sea Scallops. I must admit I was really impressed with the Scallops and Mussels. Scallops and Mussles were really fresh and tender. Due to bad experiences with escargots, i have not had it for years until I came to Mon Ami Gabi. And lets just say the escargot was not too bad. Also, i believe the mussels came with fries, which tasted like chips. Not bad. \n\nDinner was served quickly. Service was great. We didn't need to rush for the show. We had more than enough time. We ended up having time to walk from Paris to MGM. Overall, this was a fantastic experience. My gf and I will be back on our next trip to Vegas.....Mon Ami Gabi."

This may be the perfect combination.\n\nLet's pause for a moment and offer thanks for the baguette. It's placed on your table in a paper bag. So chic. But the taste: the shattering crunch of the exterior, the fresh and chewy interior, the joy of its union with the rapidly melting, slightly salted butter . . . You could just eat the whole thing yourself, or you could order lunch. Both are good choices.\n\nWe shared the butter lettuce salad, which allegedly included asparagus (didn't see many; maybe husband stole them while I was having an affair with the bread) and a huge round of goat cheese. Briefly considered slathering the rest of the baguette with same, wolfing down the whole thing, and returning to the room for a nap. No! Discipline!\n\nAhi tuna burger was moist and delicious. Lots of wines by the glass; the riesling was refreshing.\n\nBut whatever. I primly rolled up the top of the baguette bag and popped it in my purse. Nana would have been proud."

Well, that's what we were telling ourselves when we were looking around for a place to grab brunch.  I remember coming across Mon Ami Gabi when I looked at Yelp reviews, so my coworker and I decided to check out the menu and look inside.  \n\nAs we walked into the main part of the restaurant, we were blown away by a HUGE bloody mary bar.  Both of us looked at each other with our mouths hanging open.  I'm not sure if it was because I was still drunk...but the bloody mary bar had a glowing aura around it.   It was a sign.  We were meant to drink more here.  I'm still convinced that bloody marys are a panacea for hangovers.  Trust me, try it out next time.\n\nAnyway, after we finished staring at the bloody mary bar for 5 minutes, we walked to the back of the restaurant and we fell in love.  There was a beautiful outdoor seating area and the rest of the restaurant had sunlight streaming in.  \n\nThe food was great.  My coworker and I ordered two soups.  I've attached pictures for your reference. ;)  I got a porcini mushroom soup and it was DELICIOUS.  One of the best soups I've ever had.  For lunch, my coworker ordered the salad with grilled salmon and I had the croque madame.  The grilled salmon salad was very tasty.  My croque madame was very good, but I found the bread to be a bit too buttery and crunchy to my liking.  Can you believe it?  I actually said something was TOO buttery.  Butter and bacon...can't live without it. \n\nI will definitely be back for the good food, impeccable service, beautiful atmosphere, and of course, bloody mary heaven.  ;)"

  "text" : "Another trip to Vegas mean another stop at Mon Ami Gabi. I just can't get enough of this place. The food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around. I missed the waitress from before. Our waiter this time around was here and there but no connection. \n\nAs always, we had the French onion soup, a small salad, and the liver platter. The French onion soup was just how I remember it to be. Hot and gooey from the melted cheese and warming with caramelized onions and the broth. The starter salad was just mixed greens with a light vinaigrette. Simple yet tasty. The liver platter was a first and it did not disappoint. You get a generous slice of liver mousse pate. It comes with sliced crusty French baguette and pickled mini onions and gherkins. It doesn't taste like liver pate at all. It's very soft and creamy in texture. \n\nFor our group's entrees, we had the mussels that was steamed in white wine, burger du jour: open face duck burger stuffed with cheese, open faced ham and cheese sandwich, chicken and apple crepe, the ever so classic quiche Lorraine, and scallops. The mussels was fresh and delicious. It was great with the baguettes to soak up all the sauce. The burger du jour was not up to par as before. It was really gamey and needed something to counter balance that taste. But it was good nonetheless, if you like gamey duck. The opened faced ham and cheese was just good. You get a lot of the gooey cheese if you love cheese. It had a comfort food feeling attached to it. The scallops was not as big as the previous visit and it seemed a little bit overcooked this time around. The apple crepe was gigantic. It's a mix of savory and sweet. The chicken the the sliced granny smith apples goes really well together along with the white Alfredo sauce. It's definitely bigger than the normal crepes you can get at the crepe stand inside Paris. The classic quiche Lorraine was just like the previous time, wonderfully eggy. \n\nEverything was just soo yummy. I think we came in with high expectations from last time so we were a little bummed. It's still nice to see the water show from Bellagio across the street every 15 minutes tho!  See you in a few months..."

  "text" : "So, here's the scene. My friends and I are wicked hung over. It's the sort of hang over where you really need to purge a couple more times before you'll feel okay. \n\nStupidly, we decide to eat here. We stumble through ordering before realizing the magnitude of our mistake. The view of the Bellagio fountains is great and the smell of the food wafting from other tables is probably great, when you aren't hung over. However, being hung over, this place was not good. \n\nI ordered some crepe-ish thing which came with a cloyingly heavy cream sauce. My stomach just couldn't take it. Those who know me know how much I can put away, but I just didn't have the stomach to get anywhere with these crepes. None of my friends were able to find hangover friendly fare either.\n\n*******\nPlease note, I have eaten here when not hung over. It's a fairly solid restaurant, but only slightly better than Mimi's Cafe. I believe the primary value of this restaurant lies in the view and the location. There is much better French food for much less back home in SF."

Comes out hot and fresh =) yummm unlimited and free! Goes great with the butter and carrot thing.\n\nHad a glass of sangria which was refreshing and yummy =) my friend bought a pitcher and the waiter was nice enough to offer to put more ice in it.\n\nThe menu had quite a few variety: seafood, steak, salad, and hamburgers. Price was decent for a nice restaurant. I would say everything was about $10-$30 a plate.\nThe oysters ($15) was so delicious! Very fresh and they had a great vinegar sauce to go along with the horseradish. Yummy!!\n\nI ordered the prime medium well hamburger ($13) with grilled cheese, which came with a side of their frites. Hamburger was good. I loved the little pickles that came with it. The frite was yummy too, thin crispy french fries.\n\nI had a bite of the scallops and it was amazing!! I loved it!\n\nOverall I enjoyed our early dinner. I was super stuffed! I would come back again for the oysters and scallops!"

  "text" : "On our trip to Vegas my bf and I were looking for a place to have lunch and we were walking around Paris' casino floor and starving so we decided to check out the menu outside Mon Ami Gabi. I was sold on their lunch selection so we proceeded to get a table on the patio.  The hostess may have lacked some common sense because she seated us at the table that was away from the fans that sprayed cool mists, umbrellas, and in direct sunlight in 105 degrees of heat. wth!? After burning our elbows on the scorching hot tables, the servers brought out iced cold water which melted within a few seconds due to where we were seated. My bf asked for a table change closer to where everyone else was being seated (under umbrellas and fans). \nOur server was really sweet and moved us to a table towards the side of the patio and it felt nice to have that section to ourselves.  \n\nAnyway we started off with the yogurt gazpacho that was part of their daily specials menu and it was so refreshing and tart for a hot day. the soup was served extremely chilled so it was perfect. For lunch, we got the steak sandwich with caramelized onions and a chicken blt sandwich. the steak sandwich and the fresh potato chips were definitely on point. As for the chicken sandwich, it was an ordinary chicken sandwich but the portion was pretty good.  Service was great here as well; our drinks were constantly refilled before they ever reached the half way point. The patio is definitely fun  to sit in to people watch and enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street."

And to be perfectly honest, I wasn't entirely thrilled at the selection of this restaurant in particular.  I felt that if we were going to be dropping that kind of dough, we should have gone for one of the funkier restaurants that Vegas offers.\n\nBut the group had spoken, and who am I to cause trouble.  (Acquiesce is my middle name.  Yeah... not the coolest middle name out there.  But it's better than Francis.)\n\nSo to say that my expectations were low, and my grumpy levels were high would not be a misrepresentations.  Of course, the fact that I was having a great time with an awesome group of people did wonders for my overall levels of grumpitude.\n\nBut all of that was blown away once the food arrived.  The crab cakes were awesome, and the fillet minion may very well rank at the top of the list of finest pieces of meat I have ever put in my mouth.  (Shut up.)\n\nSeriously.  It was an astonishingly delicious steak.  Astonishingly astonishing.  \n\nAt that point, I was wondering if we were going to underpay with the hundreds.\n\nThe place itself is nice.  Standard high end french bistro decor, with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  I was bummed that I was facing away from them - but really forgot all about it the second I cut into my steak.  \n\nPerfect food.  Yes please."

We got a variety of dishes; pate, muscles and hanger steak.  Everything was delicious; well seasoned and cooked well.

Carmelized onions on steak, served with \"frites\". This was cooked perfectly and was a fairly large portion. My stomach was sufficiently full at the end of the meal. \n\nMy main gripe with this place was our server. She probably walked by the table only once after the food was served. Both my water and soda supply was depleted, and she was no where to be seen. As I near the end of my steak, I finally catch a glimpse of her and wave her down to ask for a refill on both. She tosses my soda and water onto the table and quickly runs off again. It's times like these where I question the mandatory 18% gratuity rule. \n\n3 stars for OK food for a HIGH price."

  "text" : "This review pertains to the lunch menu.\n\nThe Skinny: Gabi is not your friend - while the view est magnifique,  the food n'est pas tres bien (2.5), Service: efficient but tries too hard with the \"mon-sir\" and \"bon-jouer\" (3), Value: not that great considering the level of cuisine (2).\n\nWe've been to Mon Ami Gabi for lunch a couple of times mostly because of the spectacular view of the Bellagio. Accordingly, the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. \n\nWe subscribe to the \"Lettuce Entertain You\" rewards so I got a $15 gift card on my birthday. We ventured here for lunch (with an Opentable reservation).\n\nWe ordered the country pate, the butter lettuce salad (with asparagus, beets, and goat cheese), and the croque monsieur. We've previously tasted their lovely skate dish and their great burgers but we decided to try something different this time. \n\nBad move.\n\nThe butter lettuce salad was meager for a $10 dish. A small dish of butter lettuce with some scatterings of asparagus and beets underneath. An overly large slice of goat cheese (closer to a feta cheese than a chevre) made the salad overly salty. The dressing, a creamy concoction reminescent of ranch, just doesn't work with the texture of the lettuces (it's too heavy) nor the flavours.\n\nThe country pate is yet again, overly large portion of meat with only 4 thin slices of bread. The pate is not quite what we expected. There's too much meat, not enough fat which made the pate hard to spread and not nearly as decadent as it ought to be (it might be unfair but I had a great pate at Fleur de Lys a day ago).\n\nFinally, the croque monsieur. At a place like this, a croque monsieur ought to be better. First of all, no bechamel sauce - you can't have a high end croque without a nice bechamel sauce. 'Nuff said. Bread sliced too thinly (making it too hard when toasted), with very little in the way of ham or cheese, it was hard to justify the $12 pricetag. The bread was also a trifle greasy for my tastes. The accompanying frites were okay - more like chips than fries.\n\nDespite her really laboured/butchered French , the waitress herself was efficient, prompt and kind. She checked on us frequently enough and ensured our beverages were always filled.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience but I have definitely eaten more authentic French cuisine at a better value. (FYI -The above three items plus a diet coke would have cost well over $30 if we didn't have the giftcard.)"

  "text" : "My brunch experience here was very disappointing.\n\nMy croque-madame was awful. I asked for my egg to be over easy, and it came out dry, flat, and completely cooked. Not at all runny. (To his credit, the waiter noticed, apologized, and asked if I wanted the egg redone. I just wanted to eat and get going, so I declined the offer.) The bread was thin and dry, and the ham and cheese were thin and greasy. I usually expect Bechamel sauce and a side salad with my croque-madame at nice restaurants. I am one who doesn't like leaving food unfinished, but the sandwich was so unpleasant that I left half of it untouched. If a French place can't make a good croque-madame, it immediately loses a dozen points in my book.\n\nI ordered a salad. It was tiny. Nothing special. Definitely not worth $9.\n\nThe only part of the meal I enjoyed was the complimentary loaf of warm bread. \n\nApart from the food, the indoor seating is a bit too dark and chilly for a pleasant brunch. We came here hoping for outdoor seating with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but the wait was too long so we opted to sit inside instead."

Everything about it was very smooth and gave me no problems, even for a party of 7.\n\nMy friends ordered the French Onion Soup as an appetizer, but I got to try some of it.  It was pretty good, not gonna lie.  I had a very nice texture to it and was definitely still warm while we ate it through.  It was a delicious blend of salty onions, but not too much of anything.\n\nMy friends and I ordered a variety of steaks, all of which were pretty good.  I ordered the Bernaise one, which was pretty good and probably why I gave it the 4 stars.  The meat was medium-cooked as I had ordered it, but my friend who had ordered medium-rare was a little too cooked for it to be considered close to rare.  But other than that the quality of the meat was pretty good, and the difference sauces for the steaks seemed to go well with all of them, although I did wish that my Bernaise sauce was a little stronger and had a little more kick to it.  \n\nService was pretty good; they kept coming back to check up on us, however they were a little pushy on trying to get us to order more, like a bottle of wine, which we did anyways.  I won't comment on the wine because I haven't had much experience with wine, but I thought it tasted fine and pretty good with my steak.\n\nSo, overall\n4-4.5 stars\npretty good quality steak\nexcellent service (reservations included)\nseemed to have a good wine selection"

  "text" : "Was it a bit tourist-y to sit on the patio strictly to watch the Bellagio fountain shows? Yes! Was it worth it? Absolutely.  Not only was the scenery second to none, but the food we enjoyed was a treat, as well. We were able to get seated on the patio in about twenty minutes without a reservation during dinner, which was very nice also.\n\nAs we had been pretty gluttenous already, we decided to share a few items instead of ordering full meals.  We shared a delicious and reasonably-priced bottle of Vouvray, the best french onion soup I have ever tasted, a huge fresh crab cake, and an order of frites, which are very crispy and salty.  It was really tremendous, and our server was prompt and helpful in menu selections.  I practically had to be rolled out onto the Strip following the shared meal.  \n\nI can see that many Yelpers have had varying experiences at Gabi... some as great as mine, while some were left feeling disappointed.  I think if you are looking for a scenic place to enjoy a meal, you won't be disappointed if:  you are seated on the patio, sample the french onion soup and share a nice bottle of wine.  I might go elsewhere for an unrivaled steak dinner, but the experience I had was exactly what I was looking for."

  "text" : "Delicious everything, great service, great setting and inside a hotel I'm very fond of. Came for a nice dinner out with my mom while she was in town and I wanted to try Mon Ami Gabi; it was definitely the right choice. Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (that's hard to do since he came around often but was just so polite and not pushy at all). We had reservations for 8 pm and when we arrived had a 10 minute wait, so we went to the bar to grab drinks in that time. I had a Bloody Mary and my mom had a Lemon Drop Martini (very good). We were seated just in front of the kitchen so there was a lot of traffic going by. In some restaurants I think it can be annoying but it didn't bother me here. Everyone seems very professional, which is how it should be! A lot of people dress up but there are also others dressed casually, so whatever floats your boat, but they do have a no sleeveless shirts requirement for men.\n\nI had the French Onion Soup (yum), my mother had the Chicken Liver Pate which she absolutely loved (I don't really like or dislike pate so my opinion is void), and then we shared the Hanger Steak (the merlot butter was so delicious) and the Seared Sea Scallops. I ordered the steak medium rare but would get medium next time since it was a little tough to cut. Those are seriously the best scallops I've ever had, tasty and soooo tender. My mother also had 2 glasses of the Sauvignon Blanc which was very very smooth. What was refreshing to me was the music. It wasn't just piano instrumentals to fall asleep to, but they played a lot of Norah Jones mixed in with contemporary soft rock/pop songs. That might sound weird how I'm describing it but it was contemporary while still being appropriate for the setting.\n\nOur total was just over $100 including drinks and tip which I completely think is worth it for fine dining without being stuffy and amazing food all around. We were too full for dessert but I'll definitely be back for that steak and to experiment with their specialty drinks menu. I'd also like to sit outside when the weather isn't too hot, it's fun to people watch!"

Its definitely a tourist attraction, but who cares if the food is delicious and the service is great..right? \n\nThe atmosphere is dark, dim lights and fancy decorations. To sit outside, it takes about 30-45 minutes, but we were all too famished to wait any longer. The waiters were kind and helpful. Our waiter came around every 5 to 10 minutes or so and water was immediately poured. Thats what I call REAL customer service.  \n\nI ordered the filet minon avec de frites with the creamy  butter sauce  instead of the red wine (forgot what it was called). And I must say that the meat was perfectly cooked. It was so tender and juicy, it had the right amount of salt and pepper - you didn't need to put any more. Most steakhouses fail to cook their meat right because they usually come out burnt, overcooked and rubbery, but this place surpassed the failure. \n\nThe fries weren't the thick potatoey kind, but they were different (in a good way). Their fries texture were somewhat similar to Potato Chips or Pik-Nik fries. It was combination of those with real fries. if that makes any sense lol. \n\nThe portions are a lot smaller than what most steakhouses serve, but you will be very full.  I was unable to finish the rest of my own plate! The meat is cut in shorter pieces, but they are pretty thick. \n\nMy family ordered all different kinds of steaks and tried from each one and all of them were pretty delicious. None overcooked  or rubbery whatsover. \n\nI will be sure to come back to this place once I come back to visit Vegas again. I recommend this place for those who enjoy steak.  I hope it remains the same."

Thank the rains early this morning and the slightly overcast sky for the awesome 90F temperature.\n\nAnyway, we were seated in the patio area facing the Fountain of Bellagio.  Unfortunately we were way too early for any of that signature spectacle, otherwise it would have been an memorable end to a fantastic casual breakfast with friends. But let's get down to the meat of the review.\n\nThe restaurant was not full inside when we arrived, and we were greeted by three friendly hostesses at the front desk.  The patio seating area was completely packed by 9am, so business was excellent.  Our waitress greeted us with a friendly smile, took our coffee order and proceeded to explain the specials of the day.  We ended up ordering a mushroom omlete, crepe-like stake of cinnamon pancakes (these were huge), and I ordered the special eggs benedict (served with roast beef and caramelized onions).\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed with the food and here are my reasons:\nThe Hollandaise Sauce for my eggs benedict was already starting to break when it was served.  The roast beef was way overcooked and there were very little of it tucked under the poached eggs.  The side of \"breakfast potatoes\" aka hash browns reminded me of Denny's.\n\nThe mushroom omelet was okay. It is nothing fancy, and you can probably get similar quality omelet at IHOP, but the view and ambiance is better here.\n\nThe crepe-like pancakes - these were nice and thin and fluffy. The flavor was excellent.  Worth it, since the food is delicious and more unique.\n\nService:  Excellent & friendly!  Our coffee cups were frequently refilled. Condiments we asked for to make the meal better were delivered in a timely manner.\n\nPrice: includes the Vegas Strip premium.\n\nSuggestions: For breakfast, stick to the fruit or non-savory breakfast items, it appears to be better.  Or come for dinner and lunch since those offerings appears to look better."

The restaurant's patio is directly across the street from the Bellagio. Now the food: woohoo! My favorite salad is the endive salad. It is extremely fresh and flavorful. I love the filet mignon here. They typically serve it in a merlot reduction, but I prefer to get it with the butter herb sauce, which is delicious and much lighter than it sounds. The pommes frittes are perfect, thin, crispy, great seasoning. And the flavors you will find here are indeed French."

Make a note that you must have somewhat formal attire or else they won't seat you. \n\nThey weren't too pricey for the amount of food you get, you can definitely order one entree for two and an appetizer and that would fill you up, they also give you warm fresh baguette as well. \n\nI had the sole fish with frittes and veggies and it was amazing... melts in your mouth and puts a smile on your face for sure! French onion soup was pretty good, it's a pretty big bowl so don't underestimate the portions they give you. I think every entree ordered at the table including the salmon salad was delicious. For a table of 4 entrees and 1 appetizer, the bill came out to be $90, not too bad for a nice restaurant in vegas."

  "text" : "Nice if you can forget that this place is supposed to be a French restaurant. Most entrees come with crunchies - fries or garlic chips, and I hope people don't walk out of here believing that this is what French food will be like if they go to the real Paris someday.\n\nHowever, as a steakhouse, it's good. I conspired with a friend to share his steak with bordelaise sauce, and both were delicious. In turn I got the skate and shared it with him. It was good, but not great - I was expecting more of a creamy sauce as is common in French fish preparation. But it was pretty dry and of course so were the garlic chips and the veggies on the side. Bread was nice and warm. Their creme brulée was so-so - they definitely left the torch on for too long on a couple parts of the shell, and I got a bitter, burnt taste in my mouth.\n\nOh, and at the beginning of the meal 5 of us shared the scallop appetizer, which was good, but not good for the $16 it cost us.\n\nThey have an alright wine list and this is the first place in recent history that I've been to where I can get Pouilly-Fuissé by the glass -- which is great, because I'm too cheap to get a whole bottle.\n\nNot cheap, but worth going to if you want to get a good steak. Just don't look at it as a French restaurant."

  "text" : "I always seem to stop here for dinner when I get into Vegas.  This time around I had the scallops and my husband had the salmon.  Scallops were good and the salmon was absolutely delicious.  I would recommend the Merlot butter filet Mignon but if you are not a steak fan then I would recommend the salmon.  The salmon was just cooked perfectly, not to dry but absolutely moist and with the rice underneath with the lemon flavor it brought out the flavor of the fish.....yummalicious!\n\nThis is a great place to watch the water show across at Bellagio.  Reservations is a must because the line can get long at prime time and it is at first time first come for the patio, but I've found if you come around 5:30- 6:30 you have a great chance of getting patio seating.  Service was excellent every time I go there and I know every time I go to Vegas we will always stop at Mon Ami Gabi for dinner."

  "text" : "I've been to Mon Ami Gabi plenty of times -- and so I trusted it would be a  reliable dinner spot last time I was in Vegas. (July 25).  \n\nThe patio is generally highly sought after, as it provides a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Surprising, even in 100 degree heat, there was an hour wait for the patio.  We elected for the inside and immediate seating.\n\nWe were sat in front of the giant swinging doors where the servers/runners come out with all the food -- which meant that every few seconds the ambient light vanished and all I could see were giant flourescents and an assembly line worth of staff in the kitchen.  I wasn't pleased, but I knew I could \"manage.\"\n\nOur server, Sarah, was nice enough, although I could tell just how corporatized the restaurant was (I never felt she was talking to me, but rather over me, as though there were too many other important things that needed her attention).  My boyfriend and I only eat organic meat, and so we were turned off by their \"grain-fed\" steaks advertised on the menu.  Instead, we went with $100 worth of appetizers and sides. Let me preface that all the items were simple items and nothing that required a long cook time.  \n\nWe started with the chips and dip.  My boyfriend and I thought that these sounded good on the menu.  When we got them we thought they were like store bought Ruffles.  Fellow yelpers, pass on those, unless you are craving a generic potato chip.  (When we asked Sarah how they were, she didn't exactly give us an honest answer).\n\nI ordered a Caesar salad and the BF ordered the Tomato Salad.  Mine was $8.95 and his was $9.95.  His sucked.  The tomatoes tasted mealy and old.  My caesar was definitely better.  I considered it a save from the horrible chips.\n\nWe also ordered the Mac and Cheese, Scallop app, crab cake, and steamed asparagus.  There were 2 tables on either side of us.  Each of those tables had their STEAK dinners looooooonnnngggg before we got the items we ordered.  I even called a manager over to complain as it had been well over 35 minutes since we finished our salads (and unfortunately, the wine hadn't got me buzzed enough to ignore my stomach).\n\nHe quickly brought out the scallops and crab cake -- but no mac and cheese or asparagus.  When I looked at him confused, he said \"was there anything else?\"  I was pretty annoyed.  He then brought out the mac and cheese and their garlic spinach.  I told him I didn't order the garlic spinach and he said \"well why don't you keep it because we'll just throw it out.\" So I did, and he brought the asparagus.\n\nThe crab cake was just ok as was the scallop.  We both have had better.  The mac and cheese was good enough and so was the asparagus.  The \"free\" spinach was horrible.  Overly sauteed and buttered.\n\nWhen the bill came, I noticed that I in fact was charged for the \"free spinach\" and then credited for it.  It appeared I was also credited for the asparagus.  I asked the server quite simply,\" after all that you are comping me $7?  It was insulting.\n\nI'll never go back.  I was overly disappointed in the service, the management and the food.\n\nAu Revoir Mon Ami Gabi."

  "text" : "Really wonderful. Better than I expected. Our server was wonderful and really attentive but didn't hover. She knew the menu in and out, which is important to me since I'm that annoying diner who asks loads of questions. \nThey bring out a delicious and warm baguette to get you started with their shaved carrot 'accoutrement.' I honestly don't think it's a French dish, but nevertheless, it was tasty. Herbs, vinegar, and something else I couldn't put my finger on all blend nicely with the carrot. We got the jumbo shrimp cocktail to start - most of their appetizers were shell fish related and my honey is allergic, so the shrimp had to do. It was tasty, and their cocktail sauce had the lovely horseradish punch that I love. The only downside was the shrimp tasted a little 'fishy' to me. \nI had an heirloom tomato salad with basil pesto, goat cheese and baguette croutons. I would have been happy if dinner ended here. The tomatoes were so flavorful and the goat cheese was really nice with the acidity. \nWe both had steak for dinner. It's a steakhouse after all, why go against the grain? We chose their classic cut which is pounded thin. I was worried about the doneness and tenderness of the meat, but was pleasantly surprised to have a perfectly medium steak that was anything but tough. I chose to have the Roquefort sauce while the man went with béarnaise. Their béarnaise was authentic and really quite good; I've had terrible representations lately. Now, possibly the best thing about dinner were the impossibly thin and delicious frites that they serve. What machine cuts then in such a way, I haven't the slightest, but I want one in my home! They are crispy, perfectly fried and lightly sea-salted. \nMoving on to dessert (and honestly, we should have stopped to avoid the utterly bloated feeling that was to come, but if you ever get to chance to eat this dessert-DO IT). We decided on the Banana's Fosters crepe. Best. Decision. Ever. There should be movies written about this crepe. I am a banana's Fosters fan to begin with, but this had just the right amount of rum to cinnamon to banana to caramel. Oh heavens...\nWe really enjoyed our dinner here, and before tip it was UNDER $100. We were shocked. I even had 2 cocktails! Really worth it - and if you're lucky, you can get a seat outside to watch the Bellagio water show, too!"

Not going to lie, but even if the food was bad, people would still come in, watch the Bellagio show, and probably leave a little unhappy but still glad they got a pretty good seat.\nBut here's the thing - they serve GOOD food.. great food I would say and at completely reasonable prices, not to mention the free music / water show across the street. \n\nWe were able to make reservations for 9:30 after the Chris Angel show at the luxor, and although the patio is first come first serve, it happened to open up before our inside dining room table was ready. The waitress was patient, polite and helpful. We all got a great view of the bellagio which was breathtaking.\n\nI ordered the salmon that came with a bed of orzo. The portion was extremely large and the salmon was cooked beautifully. The orzo was well seasoned and I enjoyed every last bite. Watching my friends - their dishes were huge, including the size of mussels which looked like they had doubled in regular size. The fries ordered were unique, skinny and flat, something I've never tried before.\n\nNo one's bank was broken after this as prices ranged anywhere from $ 15 - $25 dollars.. and a bit more expensive for the dishes that were out of the ordinary. Everyone was completely satisfied and the hot heat just made it a perfect night to site outside.\n\nI know people who have rituals to eat here everytime they come to Vegas. I would like to start this tradition myself the next time I come back!"

I'm a fan of vintage, what can I say...\n\nWe had a lunch and dinner here this week, and both were handled very well. The burger at lunch, with an egg, was fantastic. So good in fact, the gf stole it and swapped lunches with me! Who said chivalry wasn't dead? I ended up having the open-faced crab salad sandwich, not great, but definitely fed my hunger appropriately.\n\nAll in all, Mon Ami Gabi gets the thumbs up for always providing a good meal, day or night.

Each time it's a bit different because of the season or whether it's for dinner, lunch and now brunch (the menu changes as well) but never ceases to be enjoyable. We had brunch this time. I always love sitting outside and enjoying the French \"bistro\" cuisine at Mon Ami Gabi. I think we were fortunate to find a shady table since it was over 100 degrees in Las Vegas the day we were visiting, and we were determined to sit at a table outside. \nKeep in mind that nowhere else on earth can you sit at a classic French Bistro, savor delicious food, drink great wine and watch the Fountains at the Bellagio playing \"Viva Las Vegas.\" Memorable! They may be famous for the Steak Frites, but I love the Country Style Pâté and the French Toast (which I had at brunch this visit) is fantastic, while my friend raved about the Corned Beef Hash and Poached Eggs with roasted red pepper (my stomach still ached from the nightmare of El Sombrero in Juneau so I passed!). \nOur waitress was wonderfully nice, very attentive and even was good enough to take a picture of us at our table. Truly memorable! I might even stay at the Paris next time just to be closer. Also, because of all the hassles and disappointment at the Aria, we ended up stowing our bags with the bellman here at the Paris. They were EXTREMELY courteous and helpful and urged us to come back and stay at the Paris next time. That was a great end to our trip and was really cool.

  "text" : "For my wife's 30th birthday, we wanted to have dinner at a nice restaurant with our friends.  We knew that we didn't want to go to chain restaurant like Maggiano's, but we also wanted to make sure that the place wasn't going to be too pricey.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the size of our party (20+), unless we went to a buffet, we were required to have to do a set menu.  This made finding a restaurant more difficult as the costs go up with a set menu, and you often have to settle on whatever food options they give you.  Most of the restaurants we checked out were in the range of $100-$150 per person.  And if you wanted to have beef on your menu, you were looking at the upper end of that range.\n\nThankfully, with enough research, I was able to find Mon Ami Gabi.  Not only were their prices significantly lower, but they also allowed us to customize our menu.  So we were able to choose as little or as many courses as we wanted to serve -- some of the other restaurants had 5 or more courses in the menus that included beef, thus leading to the high prices -- and we had the freedom to populate our set menu choices with any of the items from their normal menu.  So we searched through the Yelp reviews to find the best selections to put on our menu.  We ended up creating a menu that was only $50 per person.\n\nAs for the food itself.  It was absolutely delicious.  There's a reason why this place is rated so highly, the food is that good.  And our server was incredible.  She did such a great job taking care of us and making everything go smoothly.  We made sure to give her some extra tip on top of the mandatory large-group gratuity that was included in our bill.\n\nWe were definitely impressed with Mon Ami Gabi.  It's become one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas.  And if you're thinking about having a nice dinner with a large party, definitely consider Mon Ami Gabi.  Rebecca Kozdron, the Special Events Manager, did a phenomenal job in helping us plan our amazing dinner."

However, we went through the hotel and saw the crepe place and decided that we should go back to Mon Ami.\n\nWe were seated quickly, opting for an outside table as it wasn't too hot out yet (it has been up to like 108 most days we have been here). \n\nThe waiter quickly brought us ice waters and a soda for my wife and a fantastic cup of coffee for me. He told us about their specials and we looked over the menu and decided upon out breakfast.\n\nI went with the traditional Eggs Benedict and my wife had poached eggs, sausage and toast. \n\nBeing an amateur baker I also wanted to try their \"Homemade Brioche\", the waiter tried to talk us into blueberry french toast instead, which did sound tasty, but I really wanted to try their brioche, as to compare it to the brioche that I have made myself.\n\nOur food took a little while to come out, but our waiter kept our drinks refilled and remembered to bring me more creamer when it looked like I was about to run out. \n\nOur breakfast came and everything looked good (I will post pictures later). The toast that came out for my wife's breakfast looked like it came from a nice rustic loaf and was cut on the bias. \n\nWe enjoyed our food and I munched on the toasted brioche, smearing it with butter and jam (though it really didn't need any more butter). I found the brioche to be good, but my preference would have been for a bit more honey and to have it be toasted a little bit longer.\n\nAll in all, the meal was good, the service was excellent, I would definitely have breakfast there again!"

The sides of green beans and asparagus are delicious (though anything with that much butter is.)\n$8 for a wonderful glass of Pinot Noir? Wow. \nEveryone at our table ordered something different. From the moist chicken dishes to the hearty steaks we were all happy.\nIf they have the Bread Pudding dessert with caramel topping & vanilla bean ice cream (not on the menu. It was a special for the night) you need to get it. It was rich and sweet and definitely large enough for 2-3 people (we were a party of 5 and were satisfied!)\n\nService:\nThe hostess was rude. She was a 21 year old girl that held up her finger, didn't make eye contact and said \"one sec\" after my boyfriend said \"hello we have a reservation for 5 at 7pm\". I don't care if you're listening to some critical information in that ear piece of yours about table availability. Learn to multi task. Provide decent service to the PEOPLE in front of you. Smile.

The girl who escorted us to our table was very considerate in moving us to a \"better\" one away from the doors when we requested it. Our waitress was fantastic (she took my steak back b/c it was medium rare and made it medium well for me and she recommended an amazing dessert). \n\nOverall:\nVery reasonably priced dinner and wines. I don't know if I'd come back (too many great places to try in Vegas) but I'd definitely recommend everyone try it once, especially if you're looking for a more budget friendly restaurant (vs. Mario Batali's or Hubert Keller's).

Sure their steaks, cod, and scallop were tender and juicy but other than that there is nothing else good about it. \n\nService was very good and their food portions are pretty huge. This is the second place the food disappointed me in Vegas based on Yelp reviews."

  "text" : "My experience at Mon Ami Gabi was just okay. I think the number one thing that was the most disappointing was that some of the dishes were lukewarm. The french onion soup tasted great but because it wasn't hot, the gruyere cheese didn't ooze like it usually should. We also tried the croque madame, eggs benedict, and french toast. I think the food was all, on average, decent, but nothing gave it a \"WOW\" or spark. The bread was super dry and crunchy, with a hard to chew consistency. \n\nAlthough the food could have been better (in my opinion), the view was amazing! Of course, the Bellagio water show goes without saying, and it was such a great place to sit and watch during a hot summer day in Vegas! But, I think I would rather try other brunch spots in the area. Maybe this place would be better suited for dinner!"

  "text" : "For a night out in Vegas with friends this is a great choice. Our friends are locals and they insisted on taking us here. I was a little skeptic about the right-on-the-tourist-trap-strip location....but it proved to be a great place to hang out with friends.\n\nThe atmosphere was interesting and fun. It was buzzing with tourists, locals, people on dates, groups of friends, etc. Pretty much all types of people where here....dressed in jeans to fancy dresses. So whatever you wear you'll fit in just fine. However, if you're wearing heels watch your step....this place is dangerous with all it's cobblestone, super slick and random steps. \n\nWhatever you do, you MUST sit on the patio. It's right across the street from the Bellagio fountains...and a arms width away from the street performers and drunk tourists wobbling down the street trying to find their hotel. People watching and me go hand in hand....and  this place was top notch. \n\nWe tried the smoked salmon and crab cake appetizers ....both were just how I expected they would be. So far I wasn't completely wowed. Our friends said they have eaten everything on the menu here and have come to the conclusion that the trout and filet mignon are the best. So they got those, the boyfriend got the filet mignon with a wine sauce and I had a filet with blue cheese reduction. \n\nEverything came with the traditional French crispy fries....frittes. I'd pass on these if I were you....try another side instead. The sauces were really great, the meat was just ok. I've had much better steaks at chains. \n\nThe prices were pretty expensive, but you should expect that at a steak house on the strip. However, you're paying for the atmosphere and in that case I say it was worth it. \n\nThe service was great. Everyone was very attentive. That is....until they brought the boyfriend something he didn't even order. After having to prove our case with the waiter, and him telling us it would be 30 mins to get the \"correct\" order out...he finally did it. I think he wanted us to just be like \"oh ok...we'll just take this random food we didn't order, thanks anyway!\" I was pretty shocked that he was so rude about his obvious mistake. Good thing it didn't really taker 30 mins to get his order....otherwise I'd be really mad. \n\nOther than the order mix-up, this place was fun to try out. We'll probably never go back, but will always remember the great time we had on the patio with great friends. Next time, we're going to make our local friends try something outside of their comfort zone. ;)"

The weather was unfortunately a scorching 105 degrees, so we decided to sit inside instead of taking the view on the patio of the Bellagio fountains (which ironically was what we chose the restaurant for).\n\nWe came without a reservation, and got seated quickly. After ordering, our food didn't take long to come out, and everything tasted pretty good overall. I can't remember the name of what I ordered, so I guess that testifies that it didn't really stand out for me. I don't usually eat a big breakfast though, but you gotta have something in your stomach when you're walking the strip!\n\nOur waitress was fabulous, wasn't offended when my bf asked for hot sauce, and gave us a teenie, tiny, bottle of tabasco. Check was promptly given and taken care of, so we were in and out in a timely manner. We'd definitely visit again (and next time for dinner - and hopefully a great view!)."

Our waiter was amazing - described everything we wanted to know in the menu without being pretentious and even gave recommendations. Food came out swiftly and delicious. The portions are large, which made me happy. I also enjoyed the unique selection of french fare, like escargot and imported cheese. We had the sangria for the table, filet mignon, salmon, Bordelaise steak, and Au Poivre steak. All were great, I would suggest the oysters and filet mignon. We had no room for dessert, but we'll be back!\n\nIt's not the most exquisite french food or exotic, but I enjoyed: the taste, portion, atmostphere, customer service, and especially the price.

  "text" : "I don't know what people's problem is, because I loved my dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. A steak dinner on the strip, with a great view and reasonably priced. What more could you ask for? Ok sure, the steak could be thicker, but it's perfectly cooked with delicious sauce and a huge side of perfectly thin, crispy frites! Plus you can easily upgrade to a filet for a few dollars more. I was torn between having the french onion soup or the macaroni gratin on the side but I quickly decided on the macaroni. Boy was I glad I did! The side is plenty for 2 to share and sooo delicious! Plenty of creamy cheese sauce and crunchy breadcrumbs with parmesan! YUM! They have a nice list of wines by the glass, I went with a spicy Cote-du-Rhone that complemented the steak perfectly.\nPersonally, I think it's pretty hilarious that people are concerned that this is a tourist trap. I mean, HELLO! it's on the strip! Isn't this whole street the glaring, glittering, bare-assed definition of a tourist trap? Given everything surrounding it I think that this place is a gem and an exception to the  Vegas rule of being over-the-top expensive and more glitz than substance."

By my count I have been here over 15 times and to Vegas now over 70 ... \nWe all know that this place so hard to be french, the menu, the atmosphere, the wine, the waiters outfits .... who cares! They do one thing right -the FOOD!!!!\nIn my opinion, a pace that starts dinner with slated butter and a warm baguette is already really high on the culinary spectrum. Over 15 times and food is still fantastic. Fillet had the prefect temperature, the liver pate is served just the right way with the miniature gherkins and onions. It's paradise, especially if you can score the outdoor table on a perfect evening where you can watch the Bellagio fountains and the people passing by. \nOne thing of note: it is a tourist trap but than again the entire Las Vegas Strip is so if you are not happy with something coming from the kitchen let the staff know and they will gladly take care of it. \nWe highly recommend reservations as this place tends to get booked on weekends. The food is good and by Vegas Strip standards is priced fair,\nBon Apetit!!!!"

I understand that all of the outdoor seating is first come first serve so this wasn't too big of an issue. So for reference - if you want to sit outside with the view don't even bother making a rezzie, you'll be put on a wait list either way. We had cocktails at the bar right behind the outdoor patio, and the french martini was fabulous! We were sat down by a manager who was very friendly and the view was outrageous - directly in front of the Bellagio and their fountains. I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre which was very good, and my boyfriend ordered the Filet with the lobter tail which he loved as well. We also ordered a very good bottle of Bourgogne, which was only 50 bucks! Such a great deal for Vegas - not the BEST steak but it was such a steal for a view, good wine, good food, and good service. Definitely reccommend Mon Ami Gabi!!!"

  "text" : "Personally I don't think i really enjoy my experience here that much. I think the most memorable thing about this place is that when you sit outside you get to see the Bellagio water show. I find that quite nice if you are enjoying your lunch or dinner and you get a pretty nice water show performing. \n\nFood was alright. I think if i never tried Zazie then this place might just be 4 stars but it just wasn't what I call AMAZING. I didn't expected much but for some reason I find myself leaving the place quite disappointed. I think the thing that got me the most was the fact that it was warm when the food was deliver to our table. I don't get it...the dishes should of just been cooked for us and the food is warm? If you are a pretty high up there restaurant, you just don't expect to see this kind of features. I'm just not satisfy with the fact that we were brought out with warm food. It absolutely makes no sense to me. \n\nI think the bread was very disappointing. I really hated the bread that they provided us. It just didn't meet any of my high class restaurant's bread. I mean I can go to Coco's and they can serve me better and more delicious bread than them. The bread was just plain dry and it was pretty hard to bite off a piece because it was crunch. YEA...didnt like it much. \n\nTO THE MAIN ENTREES\n\nI got the Croque Madame which was alright. After I tried Zazie, it's just alright in my book. The thing I find my Croque Madame quite oily? It's okaay i think i can kinda overlook that. I also tried the French Onion soup which was quite nice. I actually find the French onion soup the most enjoyable EXCEPT that once i dig my spoon under the cheese the soup was still quite warm. Which is a big WTF for me. I tried two other dishes but as yea I think the overall was an alright to me. \n\nService...it was a so so. At first I thought the waiter was quite nice and refreshing because it seems like he is trying to have a great convo with us. You know after the main entrees was serve to us...it was like he became a ninja and just kinda disappear. The leaving experience was a lot worst.The reason why is that we asked for the check and he just forget about it. So we were sitting there for a good 10 mins until we finally asked for it again. THEN we finally got the check and leave.\n\nIt's not a must try place in my book but I wouldn't kill myself if i had to come here again."

His response? \"Whatever.  They're milky and people love them but if you don't like them I'll take them away.\"  And he did.  We ordered the country pate and my friend got a seafood crepe that she liked.  The pate was okay, but the service was crap from that point on, of course.\n\nOh, and the french bread sucked.

  "text" : "This is one of my FAVORITE places to dine in Vegas. Food is great and at a great price. Their steaks and frites are absolutely fabulous. When the weather is nice, I love sitting on the patio to people watch and see the Bellagio Fountains. The service here is usually great, but once in a while you get a not so great one. But that is okay, the food and environment makes up for it.\n\nI have been here several times, for both breakfast and dinner. \n\nIt is so lovely to have breakfast at 7am on a late summer morning to just enjoy the surrounding. And I LOVE LOVE LOVE their breakfast selection. Quite pricey for breakfast, but worth it on occasions. I have tried their Fruit Bouquet, Blueberry French Toast, Banana Fosters Waffles, and Eggs Benedict.  Definitely need to go back and try everything else, because I know it will be amazing.\n\nDuring dinner, they provide you with a wonderful and fresh french baguette, usually with the carrot spread thing, unless they have some seasonal special, but even then, you can always ask for the carrot thing. I don't even like carrots AT ALL but I love this carrot thing with the bread. And the bread goes sooo well with the French Onion Soup and the Shrimp Appetizer (both delicious on their own anyways.) Their wine selection was nice. Their steaks are cooked perfectly, and serviced with a nice portion of frites! And I am a carb fanatic and these frites are amazing. Don't know what it is about them... but I never waste good carbs! I wish they had real souffle, but they still have great desserts. I have tried their flourless chocolate cake, chocolate mousse (pretty big cup of mousse for one person) and their ice cream dessert trio thing *pictures posted*.\n\nThere's so many great things about this place. I recommend this place for all my friends and those who ask for a nice place to dine. You can make it all dressy and have a romantic date, or dress more casual for just a nice dinner. Great french dining without breaking your piggy bank."

Spending ninety bucks for a meal that is, honestly, not even mediocre -- I don't see how that gets good reviews.\n\nI had the roast chicken, and my lady had a steak.  The steak was ordered medium rare, but was delivered beyond well done.  The chicken was actually cooked nicely, but barely seasoned at all and greasy.  Ceaser salad was maybe 3 ceaser leaves with very little flair of any kind, and not much flavor.\n\nThe waitress was sweet, and our outside view was pretty.  The bread and carrot thing was tasty -- I still had high hopes at that point =).\n\nAnd the Frites -- how could you rave about them?  I found them old-tasting and unflavorful -- like a curled-up mass of stale pringles.  Maybe we just got an off evening, but the food was a severe disappointment."

  "text" : "If I had to title my review, it would be \"The Perfect Lunch.\"\n\nI have been several times now and enjoyed each time.  This last time I was there, I was able to put all of those past experiences to good use to create exactly the experience I was hoping for.\n\nA few things to keep in mind if you have never been Mon Ami Gabi.  \n\n1 - The best place to sit is on the patio, however reservations are not good for the patio.  The patio is perfect for people watching, and what better place to do some people watching than on Las Vegas Blvd!?\n\n2 - Get there 10 minutes to 11 (when they start serving lunch), put your name on the list for the patio, take the square-light-up-vibrating thingy, put some money in a penny machine and wait to be called.  Our square thing went off a few minutes after 11.\n\nAs far as what made this experience perfect, there were many factors.  We walked in and were seated on the patio at a table for two.  Our server recognized that it was a little warm where we were sitting (full sun) and offered to look for a table that was less sunny.  She found us the perfect table and it wasn't even in her section!  Plus, it was a four top, right in the center of the patio, in the shade, with the most perfect view of the Bellagio across the way.\n\nOf course, the food always plays a huge part.  A glass of house red wine to start is always nice.  The escargot was delicious, I loved using the French bread to sop up the garlic-herb butter left in the dish.  Our beautiful red and yellow tomato salad was light and refreshing with pesto and goat cheese, two of my favorite things! The steak sandwich was phenomenal.  Not too much meat, cooked to our med-rare liking.  Ciabatta was soft and caramelized onions were the perfect complement.  Frites were light and crispy with a little chew so you could taste the flavor and know you were eating more than air.  \n\nWith the Bellagio fountain show kicking off shortly after noon (on Saturday) right as we were finishing the last of our wine and paying the bill.  This was one of my top 5 favorite lunches of all time!"

  "text" : "Made my third visit to Mon Ami Gabi.  But this time was a change of pace as I went there for an early breakfast instead.  It was awesome!\n\nFirst off, Patio dining again, definitely a must when you go here as I've said before.  The atmosphere is a lot more different than it is at dinner time (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=gFFS-8Yc5e4B0s6VZiQtWg).  It's a little less hectic and more relaxing.  I could've just sat here and drank coffee all morning while people-watching.  It was that mellow.\n\nStarted off with some fresh OJ and bottomless Coffee.  I was really craving a good Eggs Benedict so I ordered their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=XMlXu9ZuqJ795S6cPb68fw).  That was really good, but then again, I'm a fan of any Eggs Benedict done anywhere.  But believe it or not, I thought it was the Hash Browns that stole the show.  They were cooked with caramelized onions so they had a nice sweet flavor, almost like latkes.  Good stuff!!\n\nBecause I was there super early, I must've had like 20 waiters serving me.  Extreme service!!  It was like every time I would take a sip of my coffee, a waiter would come out of nowhere and refill it.  That was awesome!  I gave a big tip, but I wasn't sure who it was going to.\n\nI love this place.  5 stars once again!!!"

Lots of people to watch, the fountains across the street, and most importantly, great service. \n\nStarted w/a glass of wine. We shared the warm cheese and tomato appetizer. Delicious!! They did have to bring us more bread, to completely devour this dish. \n\nI had the fish and chips. Chips are very crisp and salty...MMMmmm. Hubby had the scallops.

Good food, good wine, excellent service, and entertainment provided by the fountains of Bellagio (right across the street).\n\nThe country style pate is excellent and perfect for a light lunch.  The croque monsieur is also worth a try.  Simple and authentic.  It transports you right back to a café on the streets of Paris epically if you enjoy it with a glass of wine.\n\nThe restaurant offers over two dozen French wines by the glass. All very well chosen although the prices are high.  Wines by the bottle offer a better deal.  All French.  All food friendly (no first growth Bordeaux or grand cru burgundies).  The wine program truly supports the café feel of the restaurant.\n\nKill a few hours and people watch.  So it's a French bistro at a themed hotel.  Sometimes you just gotta be a tourist."

Hostess said would be a\n30 minute wait, no problem I'll just gamble a little. 10 minutes later, our pager went\noff. Had to wait a couple more minutes while they changed out table cloth. Anyway, received water right away. Our waiter came over very friendly, outgoing. He recommended the skate because I was gonna order the salmon. My gf got the special, prime rib w/ aus jus macaroni au gratin and green beans . Skate came with a fennel, red onion, green bean salad..it was prepared with lemon capers parsley..and had homemade garlic chips. Garlic chips were great, light with garlic taste. Skate was an interesting fish, kinda chewy but the way it was prepared was delicious. A bit salty but im certain it was the capers. The lemon was delightful. Salad was good it was light and made with oil and balsamic vinegar. Prime rib was cooked med-rare, this was delicious.  So tender and flavorful, really good. My gf wanted to send it back because it was not hot...I assumed thats the French way..I didn't even notice and I like my food HOT! The potatoes were great, nice little crunch but great texture in middle. Almost forgot, i ordered the french onion soup and it was very nice flavorful, very cheesy-yummy, and bread was good. Try it just to try it. Nice little baguette with butter too. \n\nOverall, place was great and if it wasn't for this land having thousands of restaurants I would definitely make it back here."

A few of us had the Spinach Salad with Grilled Salmon ($17) and another member had the Roasted Duck ($25).  Portions were generous and we could have easily shared a plate.  We all loved our dishes and would definitely eat here again and again!

  "text" : "Every time I come to Las Vegas I make a mental note to dine here, just for the view. On my second visit to Vegas, my girlfriends and I decide to have dinner there. After a HUGE lunch that included probably a stick of butter, a whole loaf of bread and ten strips of bacon (not that I'm complaining) I didn't want to eat anything to heavy where I couldn't fit into my clubbing outfit or be dancing the night away with a food baby. So I didn't get the steak and frites that everyone was raving about. Instead I had the lemon-thyme seared salmon with orzo, peas, leeks, spinach, and lemon butter. The salmon was a little bit dry but everything else was really good. It wasn't so heavy where I left feeling like I was 3 months pregnant. It was light and filling and the fact that I paid 25 dollars for a piece of fish the size of my 3 year old nephew's foot was overshadowed by the view. The view was beautiful, it was nice being able to look up to see the Eiffel tower, towering over my head. I also caught the Bellagio's water show about 4 times the whole time I was sitting there. I love love being able to watch the other tourist walking up and down the strip. \n\nUntil I find myself a rich heart surgeon husband who will take me to Paris on his private jet,  Mon Ami Gabi has satisfy my curiosity for the \"Parisian\" experience. It's the closes I have ever came to Paris... that is until I visit Paris... Paris Texas the way my bank account is looking."

I ordered the trout with string beans and my boyfriend had the sea bass special with mash potatoes and mushrooms. The food came out so fast it's almost questionable how they made the food so fast. But I have no complaints, the fish was cooked wonderfully moist and flavorful. With 2 drinks and 2 entrees the bill came out to $60. The price is pretty reasonable when you consider the breath taking view. I ate my food slowly and got to enjoy the fountain show at least 5 more times."

  "text" : "I've always dreamed of going to Paris for all the perks and sight-seeing one can do in such a foreign place. Unfortunately, I've heard that the French aren't too fond of ANYTHING American :( Is that true? Because I like the French. Most especially the food! I haven't been able to go to Paris yet, but the Paris Hotel may be the closest I will get to being there for a while, so, I shall enjoy what I have at the moment.\n\nThe very first time I went here was with my girlfriend on date. Often times we like to tour the city as if we've never been here and well, Mon Ami Gabi was already her favorite and she introduced this elegant place on the Las Vegas strip. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations as this place tends to become very busy and crowded. If you're lucky enough, request for the patio and it places you right across the street from the Bellagio fountains. It is a spectacular feat when you're with that special person enjoying a lovely dinner! :)\n\nAs soon as your server greets, you'll be asked for your choice of drink. I'm a water person so, I'll always get water. For you wine and champagne drinkers, ask your server what they would recommend with your meal. The servers are pretty knowledgable of the perfect dinner match. They'll serve with French bread and a carrot salad or slaw. It doesn't come with very much flavor so if you're worried about ruining your palette for what's to come, you needn't worry.  We usually order the steamed mussels in a leek cream.  It changed recently so it isn't as great as it used to be.  The whole serving size isn't the same size as what it used to be, so you won't get as much as before, but still a tasty appetizer.\n\nAnd now for the main course.......\nFilet with red wine reduction and merlot butter cooked to medium :9\"\"\" yum! This is my girlfriend's favorite steak for 1) The flavor of the reduction with the merlot butter, 2) the merlot butter, 3) The way the steak is cooked to perfection so that it melts in your mouth! Mmm... The filet is also served with frites (french fries). I have tried the different steaks like the Steak Roquefort (bleu cheese sauce) and the Steak Bordelaise (red wine). It depends on the flavor you're craving but regardless of which steak you're ordering, your choice will always be a tasty one. I've returned numerous times to enjoy the service, the atmosphere, and most of all the food. I'm already looking forward to the next time while typing this review. So I would definitely return! Enjoy and happy eating!"

These reviews may not be entirely accurate in comparison to today's current reviews, but nevertheless, they seem to fall well in line with most opinions on this site. \n\nOh, Mon Ami Gabi, you are the closest thing to a bistro in Montreal, Quebec City, or heck, even Paris I've gotten to in awhile. I've dined at bistros in all 3 francophone cities, but I have to say, Mon Ami Gabi does a really decent job for being an Americanized French bistro. Plus, the waiters are a ton nicer than you would find in Paris so you don't feel as guilty about the pricetag because you know the level of service equals the quality of the food. I had steak roquefort, and loved the thin cut frites! If you do have an appetizer, go with the fruit and cheese platter. There were some cheeses I hadn't had before like a Belletoile. My parents enjoyed the wine selection from what I can recall as well. The prices were actually pretty excellent in comparison to other super expensive Vegas restaurants, so I felt like it was well-spent here. If it isn't too busy, ask to be seated in the glass interior patio area facing the Bellagio fountains."

  "text" : "If you've never spent Halloween in Vegas, you can't possibly imagine what you are missing.  It is truly an unforgettable experience.  The costumes alone are worth the trip.  Never mind those \"racy\" costumes you see on the streets of Anytown, USA.  Here in Vegas, it's not \"Slutty Nurse\" or \"Slutty Cheerleader.\"  The theme is just \"Slutty.\"  It seems as though the whole town is trying to get away with wearing as little clothes as possible for it to still be considered a Halloween costume.\n\nThe patio at Mon Ami Gabi is a PERFECT place for people watching on Halloween.  Normally, I would be gushing about the spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains (\"gushing,\" get it?), but that day was all about people watching.  Since the moment we sat down on the patio, it was darn near impossible to concentrate on the menu.\n\nThe dinner menu at Mon Ami Gabi is a very basic one.  This is French food simplified for Middle America.  \"When in doubt, go with steak frites\" - that's my motto.  This restaurant offers a wide variety of steak frites plus a limited selection of fish, poultry and vegetarian dishes.  There is even a burger on the menu, if one is in the mood for Le Big Mac or a Royale with Cheese.\n\nI opted for the Steak Bearnaise with frites and a bowl of sweet potato soup.  My soup came right away, and the presentation was impeccable.  A single piece of meringue looked very lonely on my soup plate, until the waiter brought and old kettle with a real spout and poured some pureed sweet potatoes around the meringue.  It was kind of like Ile Flottante, but with sweet potatoes instead of custard.  Presentation or not, my soup lacked any kind of unique flavor.  It could have used some spices (ginger?  cardamom?  allspice?).  I added some pepper, but that wasn't enough.  Also, did I mention that my soup wasn't even all that hot?  Come on, guys, you have a kettle!\n\nFor a French restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi sure gives you large portions.  My steak frites came on a big plate, with a thin piece of steak literally covered in crunchy, thin frites.  The steak had been pounded with a tenderizer until it was as thin as a tortilla.  It was then marinated in wine (I am just speculating here), grilled and served to us.  It was difficult to say whether the quality of the meat was truly extraordinary, but the steak sure was tender.  Of course if you took an old shoe sole, assaulted it with a meat tenderizer and marinated overnight, it would be nice and soft as well.  The frites were not greasy and begged to be eaten with your own two hands, no fork required.  They were kind of like tiny specks of Lay's potato chips.\n\nWe stayed there on the patio for another 20 minutes after we finished dinner.  Our evening was over, but the Halloween party in Vegas was just beginning."

Why the hell would you try to order a calamari appetizer from a french restaurant without first looking at the menu, and then get mad that they don't serve calamari?  Luckily the food was good enough so that I forgot about the annoyance.  \n\nFirst the bread they serve was sooooooooo good.  The bread is a mini baguette roll that  tasted like it just came out of the oven.  5 stars alone for just the bread.\n\nWe ordered the 'Escargots de Bourgogne' for our appetizer and we both ordered the Filet Mignon for our entree.  The 'Escargots de Bourgogne' was delicious and our Filet Mignon was even better.  I've been here before but I don't remember what I ordered the previous time.  I also don't remember it being as good as it was this last time.\n\nService at Mon Ami Gabi was really good as I was checked up on constantly.  What's best about Mon Ami Gabi is that the price is really reasonable for the food being served.  I would expect to pay a little more...  I will definitely have dinner here again for their delicious tasting Filet Mignon."

  "text" : "Maybe my new favorite lunch spot in LV.  I always passed by this place over the years and am glad I finally stopped in.  Spectacular views in front of the Bellagio fountains on the patio or enjoy your meal from the glass room.\nThe escargots are very good as was my crab sandwich (open faced w/ a side of fresh potato chips).  Salads are a good option too, though maybe avoid the bacon salad as it's pretty small (waiter even warned against this).  Also fit in the french onion soup and banana fosters crepe as those are bomb.\nI generally hate Paris cause the pai gow gods despise me here.  But I'll come back just for Mon Ami.  Though I think the hostess had a bit of attitude and snobbishness (I mean get over it, you're not a Michelin restaurant), I'll deal with it."

On nice days expect waits for outside to be over an hour as we found out (we left and came back the next day for a shorter wait). Even with the wait they give you buzzers with a decent range so you can go to the bar or play some slot machines while you wait. \n\nFood was mixed at the table. The two of us with salads (a chopped and a spinach) were both dry. Across the table there were raves for the french onion soup and the escargot. Glasses of wine all around but it was mainly house wine. \n\nService was a little slow, maybe because it was so crowded. The waiter did speak with a pushed-on fake accent which got to be a little more than just a bit annoying at the end. \n\nIf not so crowded it would be a great place to sit outside and have a glass of wine and nicer appetizers than typical bar food."

Normally I don't like French onion soup and while I didn't love it I liked it more than any other I'd ever had before. For dinner I had steak frites au poivre with a glass of Beaujolais. The pairing worked well and the food was tasty. The steak was cooked just as I had ordered it, and despite being pounded VERY thin (something I usually don't like) it was actually very well done (medium rare but prepared like I want it). The frites were quite good as well and there were a ton of them. The coolest part is that you can sit out on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains. Cool atmosphere. Good food. If you can get on the patio do it."

Just go play the slots and maybe you'll end up paying with your winnings. :)\n\nCrab Cake Eggs Benedict was sensational. Best crab cake I've had, but a little on the thin side. $15.95\n\nThe Prime Rib with 3 Eggs was also tasty with a side of toast and hash browns. The complimentary jam is yum!!! Wanted to dip my fingers in and lick 'em. Which I sorta did, hehe! Only warning for this dish is the prime rib may come out more done than you wish. If you want medium, say medium-rare. $18.95\n\nGreat atmosphere, but can be a little hectic with waiters and busboys running around.

Both times we were not able to sit on the patio because there was a looong wait time and they don't take reservations. However! I have been pleased both times with the service, food, and ambiance. I think this is a good \"safe\" choice when looking to please everyone who might like different things. You've got steak, salad, soups, pastas, and more special items like lamb, olives in a jar, etc. \n\nIt's a crowd pleaser for sure!"

It is too over the top in its efforts to match the French theme...and in doing so, sacrifices much of its quality.\n\nI visited this establishment when I was on a steak hunt...trying Rib-eye steaks at different restaurants throughout the US. The steak was decent, but in trying to meet the French theme, sauced the thing to death. \n\nPerhaps there are better options on the menu...maybe I just picked the wrong thing during my great steak hunt phase. But in my opinion, there are much better places to eat on the strip that don't involve a theme other than good food!\n\nThis is my first one-star review. I would honestly consider giving it 0-stars if that were an option."

This one will be quick.\n\nWe had escargot, being adventurous and having not had it before. It was uneventful, somewhat bland, not very garlicky. Wouldn't order it again from this restaurant, but there's some chance that it's just not my thing - haven't tried it again since.\n\nOur main courses were alright. I had steak frites and the potatoes were oily and somewhat chewy, but the steak was decent and the dijon mustard sauce complimented it well. I don't remember what she had, but she wasn't very excited by it.\n\nAfter dinner, I had a coffee-based cocktail that was amazing. It saved the meal for my taste buds.\n\nThe service was fine given that it was a very busy night - we got most things promptly and politely. The ambiance was great, being a very handsome restaurant inside, and the outdoor seating that overlooks the Strip and Bellagio's lake seemed brilliant as well, though we dined inside.\n\nFor the price, I don't think this place is worth going back to, unless I get a recommendation for a particular dish that is great. But if you are excited about sitting outside and overlooking the Strip, you might want to give it a try."

  "text" : "On a busy Friday night during Veteran's Day weekend, we prayed that Mon Ami Gabi would not be fully reserved. Upon waiting in the line that took a good 5 minutes to get to the woman at the counter, I realized how popular this restaurant really was among tourists/regular visitors alike. \n\nWhy? \nWell from my experience, the prices are incredibly reasonable and the food is delicious. \nBut anyways.\nThe woman up front said it would be a 30-45 minute wait, which was great considering the place was flooded and seemed as packed as the metro during rush hour. She then handed us the vibrating 'thing'.\nWhile we waited, we went to one of Paris's small pastry shops and talked and drank some teas. After only about.. eh.. 25 minutes? I was worried that being a little far from the restaurant would prompt the vibrating thing not to vibrate, but it! Then again, I was still in the hotel and not really far... but that's happened to me before and subsequently. I lost my table. \n\nANYWAYS.\nThe atmosphere? \nWell it was still busy when we being seated, but not as busy at it was during 7:30-8. It was already about 8:30-9 when we got seated. I loved the lighting. Pretty dark, but romantic and authentic. We got seated inside (outside was packed.. clearly), and were right next to the wine cellar. Waiter and waitress would go in and out of it, but they never bumped into our table, so that was good. It was pretty loud, but still manageable to talk to one another. \n\nThe bread & butter? \nThis is always an important one for me. The bread came in a Mon Ami Gabi bag and was a small baguette, perfect for my group of 3. We split it and the butter was DELISH. I think it had something extra in it. Maybe honey? I don't know but it was great. The bread was hot and soft and amazing. \n\nThe food?\nI got the Fish and Frites and my friends got the trout and the steak with caramalized onions and a wine sauce... I think. We also ordered a side of garlic spinish which was DELISHH and I'm not that crazy about spinish. My Fish and Frites was very good. The fish was well cooked and I loved the frites. The fish wasn't too flavorful, but how much more flavorful can fish and chips be? I tried my friends steak and it was literally the best steak I had EVER tasted. \nAnd I hate steak.\nHATE IT.\nDisgusting.\nYuck!\nBUT THIS. This was something else. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the sauce on it was heavenly. The caramelized onions (which I usually don't like by itself) complemented the dish soo well and it was just amazing. If I had known how good the steak was here, i would have probably gotten it myself\nMy other friend's trout was also another testament to this restaurant's amazing food. The trout was soo flavorful and it came with green beens on the side which looked great. \n\nThe price? \nFor Las Vegas standards, A BARGAIN. my receipt was as follows:\nwater all around\n1 cosmo for the friend (11 dollars!)\nGarlic spinish (i think 4 or 4.50)\nsteak \nfish & frites\ntrout\n86 dollars! \nI was shocked. That's honestly a bargain for LV standards. The area of Mon Ami Gabi is among one of my favorites (just across from Bellagio) and if you manage to get hold of a patio seat, you have a view of Bellagio's water show. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who goes to Las Vegas.

The eggs benedict with salmon is delicious as well!  Lunchtime, I had ordered the warm olives jar and it comes exactly that.  In a mason jar, a variety of olives that has been warmed and tossed with garlic, olive oil, rosemary and lemon, so so so good!  \n\nI have yet to have a bad meal there, service is A+, they come and refill your water without you needing to ask and very polite.  Plus if you sit outside, what a view!  If the weather is a bit too warm, you can still sit in the atrium sun room that still gives you a great view of outside without the heat, or the chill if it's cold outside."

Twice I've been here to this upscale, simple restaurant, and I reserved the café seating which is the section between outdoor patio and dining hall. So I got to enjoy the Fountain shows from belaggio. I think it's the optimal seating area- you have to reserve. Because you're not exactly barricaded in a room with no view and you're not outside, either within a foot away from drunk tourists. -unless you smoke. I tried the fish. amazingly prepared.

For the price, I don't think you can have better food, service or a view in Vegas.  Sit outside on the patio for a \"front row\" view of the Bellagio water show.  It's very fancy, but the waiter's are not stuck up like other places.  Even dressed casually with a kid in tow, the French waiter was happy to discuss and let me try several varieties of wine before settling on a glass.  The wine list is good, and it helps when they waiters are in the know about what they are selling.  The steaks are what keep us coming back.  The top four on the menu are thin and huge.  About a foot long and four inches wide, they span the oval table.  Steaks are served along with awesome thin-cut crispy fries.  Steaks are in the $23 range.  We've been here 3 times now, and there is really nothing bad to say about it.  Highly recommended."

Our waiter didn't seem too happy with her job and began to walk away as she was finishing up telling us about the specials. Wow, if you don't want to be here, then don't fucking work here. At least our waters were constantly filled up by another waitress. On to the food...\n\nWe started off with the French onion soup which was by far the cheesiest French onion soup I've ever eaten. Delicious! I felt full after just sharing it with Joe. Dip some of that crusty bread in there and mm mm mm party in my mouth! I got the croque madam which was really good. I was expecting small portions but it was actually a lot of food! Or maybe French food is so heavy that you think you're eating a lot. The frites were good. They're kind of like thin potato chips. \n\nJoe got the crab salad tartine which was not good. I don't recommend it. You can barely taste the crab because everything else stuffed into the crab salad was overwhelming. You can only taste crab if you pick out a little piece of it. I don't think crab cut into tiny little pieces. The potato chips were good though!"

We would have probably been seated right away at our 9:30 reservation time if we wanted to eat inside.  But why would you?  It was a lovely November night, a little chilly, but clear, and there are plenty of heaters on the patio.  We watched several rounds of the Bellagio fountains across the street, and had a great dinner.\n\nIf you are worried about it being a \"French Place,\" don't worry, it really is not. They have a variety of pounded steaks (the waiter made several points on this), but they also have some nice, thick traditional cuts.  I had the 22 ounce bone-in rib eye, one of my favorite cuts.  It was quite a hunk of meat, but it was very flavorful and perfectly cooked at my requested medium rare.\n\nThe wince list is a little pricey, some options in the mid $30s would be nice, but we had a couple of the less expensive Bordeauxs and really enjoyed the meal.  Most of us had starters, and the bread is excellent, as are the pom frittes (that's french fries) that come with the steaks.  An excellent meal, with a great view and good service."

It's worth dining at the restaurant for the view itself, but the food will blow you away as well. Our waiter had a fake French accent and was pretty cool to talk to. \n\nMy mother and I came here for 1 reason... to eat their steak frites. They are to die for, and like I said on my profile, they would definitely be my last meal before I died if I had any say about it. \n\nThey first gave us some bread. It was a baguette, and it was delicious. I think I could have eaten the entire baguette if I wasn't so anxiously awaiting the steak frites. When the steak finally came, it was cooked perfectly, and the french fries were nice and crisp. I couldn't ask for anything more. The portions were pretty big, so I didn't finish, but I still had some room for dessert.\n\nWe ordered the bananas foster crepes, and excuse my French, but HOLY SHIT, they were delicious. They were definitely one of the best desserts that I've ever eaten. The crepes were extremely thin and filled with bunches of sliced bananas and this caramel sauce... if you were thinking that this couldn't get any decadent, they were topped with vanilla ice cream. I experienced pure bliss while eating these crepes, and you will too. \n\nSo yeah, overall if you're looking for moderately priced food on the strip with a good view and an epic dessert, you should definitely try Mon Ami Gabi."

(Note: I've also had a burger/fries and french toast there -- L.O.V.E the french toast.)\n\nWe came back for dessert later in the night with a couple friends. The hostess that sat us was kind of snotty and said that their tables are only for full dining after we told her that we had dinner earlier and were joining our friends for dessert and drinks. Our waiter couldn't care less what we ordered as long as we were happy.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Profiterole Trio and the rest of the table ordered the Bread Pudding (it's a special and not on the regular menu) and the Chocolate Mousse. My profiteroles could've been better -- I was expecting a cream filling and not ice cream, but that's what i get for not paying close attention. I should've jumped on the bandwagon and got the bread pudding instead. I didn't try the chocolate mousse, but it's chocolate and I'm sure you can't go wrong with that either.\n\nThe specialty drinks were so-so. Pricey for what it is. Instead, order your favorite drink from the full bar and it won't cost you $12.95 in disappointment.\n\nTheir prices are reasonable and the food is excellent.

My friend subbed a croissant for the toast.  The croissant was very hard when she tried to break it apart.

  "text" : "Delicious ... great atmosphere ... great service!!! The value? Well, that's relative to what food costs in Las Vegas. I thought it was decent pricing for great food. We went for lunch on Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend. We did not have reservations. We were told the wait would be 15-30 mins but they buzzed us for a table within 5 mins. We were seated outside, near the sidewalk in the front, with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains (we were able to watch 2 fountain shows while seated). They serve you a mini-baguette while waiting for your meal. I loved it, the hubby didn't love it as much as I did; then again, I'm a breadie. I had the French Onion soup (perfect for the cold day we had - it's not something i'd recommend having in the middle of the day in summer). The Gruyère cheese on top of the soup was YUM! For an entrée I ordered the Macaroni Gratin. It's not Kraft mac-n-cheese. This is adult macaroni with cream, butter, and more Gruyère! I shared this with the hubby who ordered the Steak Frites with the caramelized onioins and red wine sauce. I would've licked this sauce off the floor if the plate was dropped. It's that good! The frites were not pomme frites, which is what I was expecting. They were very small, thinly sliced french fries. Blah when paired with the delicious steak. It needed a heartier side. The frites would've been perfect with a burger. We were not able to order dessert, as we were stuffed. I believe the bill was around $50 for all the food we got. Also, we only had water (hangover nursing) and did not partake in the wine. The wine list was extensive and on a normal day, the wine would've been tested. This is the reason for the low food bill. Will we be returning? YES!!! We will never go to Vegas again without a stop at this lovely restaurant.\n\nI do recommend this for adults. I do not recommend this for children. Even though they have a children menu, I think taking your kids will ruin the experience for the other adult patrons. Take your kids to McDonalds or the buffet. Please do not take them to this restaurant!!! Let's leave this place to being intimate and romantic."

  "text" : "My Friend Gabi or Mon Ami Gabi (in case you didn't know what it meant in English, Gabi is short for Gabino the owner/chef) is probably my favorite local steakhouse. I bring all my closest friends here, whether they're local or visiting.  My boyfriend hosted my surprise bday party here too, so they do great with groups.  MAG is always a sure fire hit and it's the kind of place you know will impress and satisfy your guests without seeming overly booshie. \n\nWhile the food is always superb I think the ambiance and location really makes it an instant crowd pleaser, even before we crack the awesome fresh warm baguettes (that keep coming by the way, all you gotta do is ask).  In the evening the lighting is low and romantic with candles at every table.  In the day, the wonderful floor to ceiling window/doors from the patio let wonderful natural light in.  The key selling point is the patio seating that gives u a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  You can't reserve patio seating though so you can try to reserve a table in the atrium that sometimes gives just as good as a view :) \n\nNow for the food!\n\nMy must order every visit is the Fliet Mingon with Merlot Butter and the Steamed Mussels for an appetizer.  My first couple times I've tried some other steak variations and sauces but my heart belongs to the filet! :) I order it medium and it's just melt in your mouth \"Mmmmm\" after every bite good.  \n\nSteaks can be prepared anyway you like. They have set pairings like a certain cut with a certain sauce however, you can pair any sauce with any cut of meat just ask :) Oh and every steak comes with frites (or awesome French fries)! \n\nThe steamed mussels are my absolute favorite the sauce they come in is a classic white wine with leeks and bacon but done to perfection!  Make sure you dip your warm French bread in the sauce it's delicious! \n\nLunch is also a good option here because they serve great specials not normally on the menu.  The last time I went to lunch and brought my cousin's bachelorettes/bridal party here and the steak sandwich was sooo delicious! My sister ordered it and I ended up eating half  of it and my filet (yes I still ordered my filet at lunch...it's that good)!\n\nSo if you're looking for an awesome casual steak place on the strip that really gives you or your guests that \"I'm in Las Vegas\" feel give Mon Ami Gabi a try, you won't be sorry."

  "text" : "I guess the French chefs at Mon Ami Gabi don't know how to make turkey! (Nor filet mignon)\n\nWe went there for Thanksgiving. They had a prix fixe menu for the occasion that comes with all the standard Thanksgiving items (turkey, yam, stuffing, gravy, etc), as well as the rest of the menu they usually have. My wife ordered the prix fixe, and found the turkey to be so salty that it was uneatable, on top of being over cooked around the edges. The gravy itself was also very salty. The only thing good on the menu was the yam, which ended up being her entire dinner. We were in a rush to catch a show, so we didn't have time to ask the chef to re-make it or bring out something else, although I'm sure for Thanksgiving, the turkey is already made in batches, and probably over-brined, which means they couldn't make it less salty if they wanted to at that point. \n\nI myself ordered the filet mignon off of their regular menu. The filet itself was just ok, also quite salty, although still eatable. However, it makes you wonder why we're paying these prices if I can grill a better filet at home myself. The sides on the plate around the filet was simply a huge portion of fried shredded curly potatoes, that had no taste, but full of grease. It was all over the plate around the filet, all curly, looking like pubic hair... absolutely not appetizing. \n\nI have been to many many French restaurants. Some more expensive, some less, so I feel like I have a good idea of what level of food goes with the level of price. For the level of quality at Mon Ami Gabi, I would have to say the food is far from being able to justify the price."

  "text" : "Meeting up with friends for lunch, we stopped at Mon Ami Gabi Restaurant as it was close to another stop we were making. The other 4 were already there (coming from the Venetian) and I was on foot coming way down from the Luxor. Needless to say, I was holding up the crowd. The rest of the party could not be seated or put their name on the list until I arrived as well. When I finally did arrive, we were seated outside on the patio - which was a plus. Nice weather, good views - but the table was very small. Too small to crowd 5 people around. Inevitably, there was frequent bumping from people walking by on their way to and from their tables. \n\nI thought the service was a bit lower than expected. One guy came out to give everyone water. He filled up everyone's glass and when it came to mine there was only enough for 1/3 of a glass. Did he get more? No. So I drank it thinking it would be a sign to bring more - but it wasn't. We did receive two sleeves of baguettes. One saucer was filled with the olive oil for dinner and there were four other saucers for people to put their bread - except there were five of us. I had to eventually stop someone and ask for a plate. \n\nLooking over the menu I selected the Caesar salad. When everyone's plate was brought out everything looked so good. Another guy at our table ordered another kind of salad and it was huge - then mine came out. It was one of the smallest, most boring things I have seen ever: a few strips of lettuce, some cheese and a shard of bread - all for the nice price of $9. \n\nI could definitely do without a repeat visit here."

  "text" : "I don't know what it is about this place. I always want to dine here when I'm in Vegas. I have relatively no desire to dine at its sister restaurants in Reston and Bethesda. They pale in comparison to Vegas. The service here is always phenomenal, the food stellar. They have a varied wine list, but their \"frangria\" (sangria) is what brings us here. Yes, not the steaks. The sangria. Most places either add too much wine (a rare instance but not necessarily a bad thing), too much fruit/juice, or water it down with ice. This french bistro chain gets it right, the perfect ratio with fresh sprigs of rosemary to give it that je ne sais quoi. They've raised the price of the sangria to $19, but it's still reasonably priced compared to wine by the glass or half-bottle.\n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the roasted sweet potato soup. This is one of those entrees with a pretentious presentation, but Mon Ami Gabi tones it down a touch. My server sets an average-sized bowl at the table and has a tea kettle that dispenses my soup. It's then garnished with a toasted orange meringue. My friend went simple and decided to get the handmade potato chips with dip. The chips were ridged, crispy and not greasy, and tasted great with my soup.\n\nTheir steaks are too thin for me, and I am not a fan of their steak frites. The filet mignon is good but I didn't want to spend too much on dinner, so I got the Seared Sea Scallops with spinach, whipped cauliflower, and brown butter. Four fat diver scallops, cooked to perfection, drizzled with brown butter and garnished with parsley. Add some lemon juice and it was divine. My friend ordered Beef Bourguignon (slow braised in red wine, buttered noodles, bacon, mushrooms). She really couldn't taste the bacon but the beef was very tender. She is a big fan of short ribs so this dish was right up her alley.\n\nWe were too full to get dessert and later wandered into Paris to gamble and I won $6 from the penny slots! We have never had an issue walking in without reservations but we generally go to dinner earlier in the night and we're just a party of two. I would recommend reservations for larger parties. All in all, a good night, and we'll certainly be back."

We requested a table for 5 outside since it was nice and we could watch the Bellagio fountains while we hung out.  \n\nThe mini baguette that they brought out to eat while we wait for our food was pretty good.  Crusty and chewy, just like I like it.  Like I said, I was planning on the french onion soup but when I heard that one of the specials was bouillabaisse, that's what I wanted.  I like seafood.  It was cold outside.  Perfect.  Soup was very flavorful and fresh.  The mussels and clams were tender and sweet.  The fish was perfect.  Not mushy but just firm enough.  And last but not least were the scallops.  Nice, big and sweet.  Not tough but tender.  And to top it off, some really crusty bread slices to sop up the liquids.  Trust me, you want to get all of it.  \n\nI also shared the chicken liver mousse with my buddy.  That was delicious.  Put that on the toasted points and it was a homerun.

My girls and I were mad craving for breakfast food after a night of shenanigans we'd very much like to drown in some strong coffee and greasy eggs. It was between Mon Ami Gabi or Hash House A Go Go but we were still feeling pretty fancy so we chose Mon Ami instead.  Prices are average for French brunch, anywhere between $8-$15 for an entree. I ordered the eggs benedict, one friend ordered the soup of the day, and the other two ordered blueberry french toast. It's well known the French love their food in modest portions so we went in very such expectations. Color us surprised when our plates came out and the portions were NOT so modest. I'm fairly certain a French person would've scoffed at the sight but wow, for $14 I got 2 eggs benedicts and a huge hash brown (I was very delighted since I had been craving for hash browns all night). $11 gets you 3 huge pieces of blueberry french toast with house whipped cream. And I forget how much the soup du jour was, guessing between $7-$9. Everything came out very fast, which pleased us greatly since we were STARVING. Food was excellent. The blueberry french toast was absolutely delicious, no need for syrup whatsoever. Probably the best french toast I've ever had. Needless to say, we couldn't finish the food completely. I don't think any of us anticipated how much we would be getting. Regardless, it was a lovely experience overall. I'm sure they make their Parisian forefathers very proud. \n\nP.S.

Though our pockets/wallets suffered a bit, our hearts and stomachs surely didn't.\n\nFirst of all, I had the Frangria at the bar - a French twist on the Spanish classic and it was quite delish. We were then served piping hot bread with butter, and I ordered the Steak frites a la bernaise (yum!!!). I had the meat medium rare (which was delivered perfectly). Fries were not your normal American steak fries, but thin slivers of potatoes (a la francaise).\n\nThe only thing that bothered me was the fact that our waitress pronounced \"gratin\" in a very thick, American accent. I don't mean to be too posh about this, but if you work in a French restaurant in Paris (granted you are still in Vegas - but still!) you should be able to pronounce some things in a slight French accent.\n\nNonetheless, my compliments go out to the chef!"

  "text" : "In my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par.  A poor testimony to mandatory gratuities.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food here is above average and within our party of 5, nobody complained about the food.  I had Eggs Benedict and they were very good.  And, I just don't think you can complain about the venue; it is in a fantastic location and well maintained.  We've eaten here twice now & both of those things have been consistent.  And, for the location & quality of food, the price point is fair.\n\nAhh, but there is a catch.  Their service is poor.  The girls up front must be the manager's daughter's friends or something.  I stood there for over 5 minutes after our initial conversation before I got a response & then, only after I asked (for the 2nd time) where my party was going to be seated - and during that time, the only person to even come to the station was a person on the way out to make a quick comment.  I was early and on a mid-week day, so there wasn't a lot of traffic.\n\nTurns out, they don't open the patio until about 9 am.  So the little girls at the front, had me sit at an inside table (even though I requested a patio table & was told it was 1st come / 1st serve & I was there at 8:45 & I told them the rest of my party would not be there until at or after 9 am).\n\nWhen everyone arrived at about 9:05, they asked if we could sit outside, so I asked the bartender who to ask about that & he pointed me to the floor manager who arranged it.  This, of course was an unnecessary move, but whatever.  I left a good tip for the waitress who had served me coffee (only) and moved to the patio table.\n\nLater, after I received my meal, I asked my waitress for a condiment & she seemed pleased to get it.  Later, when it had not arrived and my meal was getting cold, I reminded her again & she acknowledged that she had forgotten.  Yeah, I never got that condiment.\n\nWhen I got the bill, an 18% gratuity was added to the bill.  Now, a couple of comments on that.  1st - the waitress told me the bill included the gratuity & that was fair of her - i've had that before, of course, but I do feel like they're trying to see if you're paying attention if they don't disclose it.  2nd - 18% is less than I typically tip for good service - but in this case, I would have tipped less, our server didn't deserve more, for sure & since I assume they share tips with the greeters, it surely would have been less.\n\nSo, in my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par."

We walked from the Monte Carlo to Paris and I have to state that it was one of the best walks ever. :) I haven't really cavorted the strip like that and I felt I was young again...what am I saying, I'm not even that old!\nWe were seated within 3-5 minutes of getting into the restaurant. Everyone has to wait in the bar area for a table. Finally, our host took us to our table outdoors. The view is spectacular. Just as we sat down, the fountain show at the Bellagio commenced. It would've been the most ideal late lunch ever,  but it ended up raining and we has to take a booth inside. boo hiss argh.\nThe booths are comfy and it's dim inside, which makes the setting very romantic. there's the more lit area where I'd hang with my friends, then the outdoor patio if I wanted some air.\nI ordered the brie, green apple and chicken sandwich which was not what i expected. I consider myself a huge BRIE and APPLE fanatic...but this one was bland...barely any chicken in my sandwich and it was dry! The soup du jour, which was a cream mash potato mussel soup was DELICIOUS! I almost ate it all with the baguette they give you. The baguette was a little burnt at the bottom, but did not taste bad. I also ordered a bloody mary with extra horseradish...it was ok. Best bloody mary I have had was at Bear Mountains hands down, but I'll try anything once.\nMy friend ordered the croque monsieur but instead they gave him a croque madame, which we didn't realize until the bill came out. At that moment he exclaimed why his meal didn't look right. It was missing the creamy sauce on top.\nAll in all, I mayyy come back here to try their make your own bloody marys. As for the food, I was not impressed. We will see how the make your own bloody marys fare in Feb 2011!"

It helps my mental health to confirm my observations and simulate my sense of humor by reading other reviews by world class esteemed reviewers:  LOL such reviews... and I quote:  \"I went for the fish and chips....\"   This is odd as it is more an English dish rather than French. and another quote:  \"what is a \"bloody cod? sounds kinda nasty\". Who would order \"fried cod\" ata French Bistro?\n\nAnyhooo, one of the great joints on the \"strip\". Food, Service, Location deserves the 5 stars, but cannot hand those ratings out with impunity.\n\nSummer Time (oh, there is a song by that title) it is GREAT to sit outside and watch the world go by (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd world), Winter Time (no song title) inside is a bit dark but elegant (ok, some consider this romantic), and a bit crowded. \n\nFood & service are always excellent.

  "text" : "Me: Is that the line for Le Buffet?\nHe: Yep\n\nNot willing to wait in a long ass line for buffet food, even though this city is where buffets are the norm, we walked up to the front and decided to eat lunch here.  Christmas is just a day around these parts, so the inside wasn't crowded.  We opted for the patio and got a street side table where we could see the water show at Bellagio.\n\nBottle of Cotes du Rhone - check\nsmall loaf of hot bread - check\n\nFeels like we're in Paris without the long ass plane ride.  The only difference is, although it's not so obvious, they do want to turn the table.\n\nThe crispy crab cake appetizer came with a jicama and cucumber slaw.  It was good, but could have used a little less breading.  The specials sounded great and I first ordered the sandwich, but the partner ordered the steak frites with the brandy peppercorn sauce because there were three to choose from.  Looking over the menu again, there was a caramelized onion and red wine sauce....SOLD!  The steaks were cooked to order, a little tough, but good.  The partner said he expected more peppercorns.\n\nThe frites were interesting.  More like large potato shreds fried crispy, so sort of like a cross between a fry and a chip.  I thought a little more arugula on the plate would've been nice.  We enjoyed our meal so much, we came back for dinner a couple days later.  We pretty much ordered the same.\n\nExcept, I had the filet mignon with merlot butter,  and the partner had the caramelized onions.  We shared a butter lettuce and crispy apple salad.  This also came with grilled beets and goat cheese, and was very tasty.  And then our over indulgence kicked in and we had the chocolate mousse, creme brulee, and a trio of ice cream in pastry.  So a buffet of desserts...LOL!\n\nThe service was great!  Attentive and friendly.  The view of the street is by far the best part.  Watching all walks of life going by was interesting.  It may not be the real Paris, but it's close enough and cheaper to get to."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi wasn't originally part of the plan during our 3 day Vegas jaunt. However, in killing time before meeting friends at the Palms our tummies let us know it was time to get some pre-drinking eats in. And lo and behold Mon Ami Gabi appeared out of the corner of the Paris Hotel & Casino lobby like a mirage. (Actually my buddy has been raving about this place since our arrival, but her sales pitch couldn't deter us away from other eateries such as N9NE.)\n\nWe arrived shortly after 10pm and was seated right away. We were offered our choice of indoor or outdoor sitting, but since it was Dec 28, we opted for inside and got a great view of the Bellagio.\n\nBeing our 2nd meal of the evening we ordered two appetizers and a glass of Rose and MAG's very own Pinot Noir (pretty damn good). \n\nThe chicken liver mousse was good, especially when paired with the 'burgundy red wine mustard' which seemed to be regular Dijon mustard with a hint of red wine. My only issue with this dish is the pate to toast ratio. The pate slab was very generous compared to the accompanying 4 toast wedges. \n\nThe frisée salad was what I was waiting for and was disappointed when the server came back to tell us they were all out of frisée. I didn't want any of the other salads on the menu so I asked him if they can substitute the frisee with arugula, endive or even mixed greens (something similar in nuttiness). When the dish arrived the croutons, bacon bits and poached egg were sitting a-top a mountain of romaine!!\nBoo-hoo sadness!!!  But after a bite, the disappointment was gone. The dish was delicious and I just may ask to have the salad made with romaine for future visits. \n\nAll in all a great dining experience. The Pinot was great, as with the savory food coupled with great company and the extraordinary view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  And might I add, a better dining experience than N9NE."

The NY Strip was served 2 temperatures overcooked. My girlfriend's salad was taken away before she was finished because there was no room on the table for an extra plate and they brought our Main Course out to us before we finished our salads. Absolutely awful experience. You should have seen the sight of everyone who ordered the steaks sawing away at the rubbery excuse for steak. I kept wondering if it was MUTTON!!!!"

I had the filet, and I have to admit, I had to struggle a bit for a clean cut. The hanger had really good seasoning and flavor. When I order dessert, it HAS to be with some type of chocolate. HOWEVER, since the bread pudding was seasonal, we opted to be different and try it. It was warm goodness!!! I would have probably requested a side of hot fudge, but oh well.\n\nThe service and ambiance truly deserves a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, I expected more with my steak.

The buffet line at the Bellagio was too long, so we looked for the closest alternative without a long wait.\n\nLunch was amazing starting with warm baked bread and butter, and awesome smoked salmon and brioche and capers. We had the steak frites, ordered medium rare, but it came out closer to medium well. The waiter gave us two sauces. The blue cheese sauce was nicely buttery, but be sure to break up large chunks of cheese for a more blended flavor. The second sauce were caramelized onions in a nice, but powerful red wine sauce. Tip: Pour blue cheese sauce over steak and fish out onions to top your cut gives you the flavor of the soaked in wine sauce, but it doesn't overpower the dish. The frites reminded me of chip like fries, thin and crunchy like chips, shaped like fries. The thyme seared salmon was beautifully cooked, moist and topped over a bed of orzo spinach and peas.\n\nThe cocktails are delicious, yet strong. The Nutty Russian was my first drink of the day, but by the end of it, I was close to drunk. But then again at $12.95 for one, I better be drunk after.\n\nOverall, with a view of the Bellagio water works and plenty of people watching, it was a pleasant meal and I'm definitely coming back to try the mussels in herbs and white wine sauce.

She read about Mon Ami Gabi and wanted to try their breakfast so we made our reservation via Open Table for December 27th at 10 AM.  When I made the reservation, there was a box I could write a note to the Maitra D'.  I wrote we're celebrating my sister's belated birthday and she wanted to have the breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi.  Hoping we could order a dessert and I could ask them for a candle or something for her but when we get there, we're never asked about it at all. \n\nWe were there a few minutes early.  I don't know how long she's been working for that day but the hostess at the door wasn't very welcoming and didn't even crack a smile.  The popular patio was wide open and it was a very nice morning so we decided to have a table out there.  She took us to the very end of patio where nobody was around, even though only less than 20% of tables were occupied at the patio.  It was still chilly and the heating pole wasn't lit yet.  When we asked her about it, she said it should be turned on soon and she left.  I was worried if our first experience at Mon Ami Gabi would be like her, stuck up with a horrible attitude.  However our waitress came immediately after the hostess left and told us this spot would be too cold for us and the heating pole was not working so she moved us to the right in the center where we're surrounded by three working heating poles.  If I were a manager or the owner of the restaurant, I would hire someone at least smiles for the \"greeting\" hostess.  I say the first impression is very important.\n\nUnlike the unfriendly hostess at the door, our waitress was fantastic.  She was very friendly and attentive, she made the rest of our M.A.G. experience so much better.\n\nThe coffee was pretty good, not too weak but not too strong or bitter.  Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also good.  I've ordered their crab eggs benedict with breakfast potatoes and my sister ordered chicken and cheese crape.  When I saw my eggs benedict's potion, I was not sure if it would fill my big tummy but it did.  I didn't see the big chunk of crab meat but it sure did taste like crab and the buttery home fries (breakfast potatoes) were tasty too.  My sister's crape had some brie cheese in it and had a very elegant taste.  \n\nWe're too full to order any desserts but I still wished if they asked me if I wanted to do something for my sister. \n\nBy the end of our breakfast, the patio tables were completely full.  It was too early for Bellagio's fountain show but still it was fun to watch people who past by.  At least we had three or four people who shouted \"Viva Las Vegas!\" or something like that during our 1.5 hrs or so dining time and I thought there were more variety of fun and wacky people out there than my hometown Los Angeles.     \n\nThe food was good if not exceptionally great.  With the patio seating and the great service we've got from our waitress, we'll be back for breakfast or lunch."

  "text" : "Yes, the location is great, and the outdoor patio very inviting, but our brunch at Gabi was very disappointing. It was a cool, rainy day, so we sat inside. First, we ordered some fresh-squeezed juice. He had orange, which he enjoyed. I had grapefruit, which tasted like it had just started to turn...bitter with almost a fizz to it.  Next, coffee. It was on the weak side, and since I sweeten my coffee with honey rather than sugar, I asked for some...twice...it never came.  \n\nI had seen the chocolate-bacon waffle with warm maple syrup advertised from the street, and had been fantasizing about it for days. I ordered that, while the bf ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  Both entrees arrived barely room temperature, but it had taken so long already we decided against trying to flag the waitress down again. The corned beef had good flavor, but the meat was a little stringy. The waffle was decent, but the saddest part was the \"hot maple syrup.\" Now I am a New-England girl, and picky about my maple syrup, but I think anyone paying $12 for a waffle should rightfully expect real maple syrup.  This was not. It was the typical maybe-maple-flavored corn syrup you'd find at any cheap diner. Yuck! Totally unacceptable. \n\nWe finished quickly and left. In a way I regret not speaking up, but it wasn't the server's fault, and it was so busy... Maybe the location and views from the patio are enough for some, but if you're going for good food I'd go elsewhere."

The place is always packed so make sure you have reservations and definitely sit at the outdoor patio to enjoy a great view of the strip and Bellagio's water show.  Their moules frites and steak frites are delicious.  Their cocktails are awesome too but if you don't drink, fret not, you'll also walk out french fries wasted since almost every entree comes with fries lolz.

My party of 6 came here for lunch on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately. \n\nI ordered French toast from the Brunch menu, ~$10. I don't even like French toast all that much - but it was perfection. The toast was soft and spongey, and it came with really good blueberry jam/sauce. The whip cream was also very light so I didn't feel bloated after. \n\nThe $3 coffee was also really great. They give you free refills, which I failed to realize when I gave a waiter my cup. It's not too bitter, and tastes perfect with a bit of cream. \n\nOther notable/good dishes:\n+ Jumbo Lump Crab Salad Tartine\n+ Most of the salads \n\nAfter the meal I felt full in a very satisfying way - great place to sit and relax and enjoy your food and the view."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is a quaint French restaurant, located in Paris Resort and Casino. It was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. The decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in France. Casual and delicious! \n\nService was OK in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. However, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so I can't complain. Bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\nI recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. Their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. If you have never had escargot, I would recommend trying it at Mon Ami Gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\nI came here on weekday afternoon. We started with the Escargots de Bourgogne which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. I believe this is true, butter makes EVERYTHING tastes good. ;) I like escargot and this dish made me like it more. If I had a larger group and a bigger appetite, I would have tried more dishes from their Hors D'Oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. I would recommend Country Style Pâté, Chicken Liver Mousse, Sea Scallops Gratinées  and Oysters Du Jour if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nFor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nFor brunch, I have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nThe two of us ordered the Croque Madame and Seafood Crepe for entrees. Croque Madame was fine but the seafood crepe was show-stopper. First of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a béchamel cream sauce. The shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. And the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. Definitely recommended!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. Our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. Also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. Love!"

The place was dimly lit, nice on a date, not so nice if you'd like to do some work or read (I read the reviews saying casual). I started with a mixed green salad which came with a nice light vinaigrette but the greens could have been cut down to a bite size so I didn't have to feel like a rabbit. For my entree, I had the special for the night which was a half roast duck in sweet sauce.  The hint of licorice was a nice touch and added some kick to an otherwise standard dish. However, the half duck was just that, and you will need experience as a butcher to cut through it in a non-insane way.\n\nThe server was polite despite my odd appearance, trying to catch up on some reading in a dimly lit restaurant. There was the added bonus of having a magical experience with the Bellagio water show out the window.

Even when it's cold out, this is the best place to eat as you get a really great view of the Bellagio fountains during your meal.  The inside has a nice ambiance as well, but get a table outside if you can.  \n\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, refilling water, asking if we wanted more bread (the bread was delicious, btw), etc.  She even anticipated that we wanted separate checks and was more than happy to arrange it, which sadly most restaurants get very bitchy about.\n\nWe all got a steak entree with frites.  Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.  I had the steak bordelaise, which had a yummy caramelized onion and wine sauce with it.  My friends had the filet mignon and the steak bearnaise, which were both very good.  Perhaps it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but still excellent.  And with the addition of the ambiance and the service, I have to give this place 5 stars.\n\nTo clarify, this is a $$ restaurant if you order a non-steak entree (they have burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish etc.) or a steak frite entree (the thin cuts of steak) without drinks, appetizers or dessert.  If you order one of the more select steak cuts or start adding sides to your meal, this is more of a $$$ restaurant."

If you've read about my past experiences here, then you'll probably already know what to expect from this review.\n\nIt was very chilly outside when I had breakfast here for my last meal in Vegas before flying home and it was also still early so the heat lamps out on the patio weren't fired up yet, so they had seated at a very cozy table by the window, which was still a great spot for some early morning people watching.\n\nSince I didn't want to take the risk in picking something new that could potentially result in a disappointing last meal in Vegas, I took the safe option and went with their Eggs Benedict (14.95) since I had their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (15.95) last time and loved it.  And once again I had their fresh OJ and bottomless Coffee.  As expected, the Eggs Benedict was perfect (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=JwV3dbADg-18GS6NESEBSQ).  Every bite was scrumptious!  And once again, the Hash Browns were packed with flavor with the caramelized onions inside.  Loved it!!\n\nAnd there isn't much more I can say about their morning service other than it was spot on like last time.  Though it was a little more busier, I didn't have 20 or so waiters refilling my half empty cup of coffee every 5 mins.  Oh well, can't complain too much about that since I still had a very good waitress.\n\nI'm really starting to enjoy Mon Ami Gabi a lot more as a breakfast option as the place is more mellow and very relaxing compared to the more active atmosphere for lunch and dinner, but you do miss out on the Fountains of Bellagio as they start up later in the day.  If you haven't stopped by here yet for a bite, give it a try and dine out on the patio when the weather is nice.  It definitely makes for a great first or last meal in Vegas."

The menu had all sorts of good red meat choices: steaks and whatnot; and some onion soup, etc.  But the pricing seemed ... eh ... a little high.  But whatever, we managed to get a seat at the teeny bar (seats 6-8) and talked it up with the bar guy, really cool dude.\n\nThis is going to sound boring, but Dave and I ordered the onion soup and shared a burger (we did not intend to go all out this night), which was the perfect choice for the bar seating, right?  Heck yes. The burger was simple in its presentation, nothing out of the ordinary, but the cooking temp and size and vehicle were stupendous and delicious!

I ordered a caraffe of the Frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of Perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared a shrimp cocktail. Our friends ordered a Caesar salad and a French onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!\n\nI ordered the steak classique rare. My boyfriend ordered the sea scallops, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. One thing I noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. It looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! Everything looked fantastic! I have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because I had ordered it rarer than usual. The finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. At the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! Next time I am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a crème brûlée\n\nMon Ami Gabi's prices were another big reason I chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. The prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. I will definitely be returning to Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate my birthday!\n\nAlthough the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic French bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very American boyfriend and his friend. They ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! So I recommend Mon Ami Gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. But if you're not into French restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the Bellagio Buffet across the street. : )"

Also, if you're at a good table, you'll have a good place to people-watch because the restaurant itself is on a prime location on the Vegas strip. If this place is expensive to you, then it's probably because of the location of the restaurant.\n\nAs far as food, all I got was the Onion Soup and the Escargot. The Onion Soup was good but I've had better Escargot. The free bread they provide was also pretty tasty.\n\nOverall, my experience here was good and I'd come back, especially since it's a central location on a strip and the food is good.\n\nLastly, our server was kind of creepy."

The reviews sounded promising, so we decided to give it a try. The ambiance and view were great - right across from the Bellagio fountains. We got to see the water show every 15 minutes which was fun. It was freezing out but the heat lamps kept us warm enough. Service there is top notch and we loved our waiter.\n\nAs for food, we ordered two bowls of the french onion soup. I thought it was okay but I've had better. I liked that they used gruyere cheese but I thought that there was just way too much cheese and that the soup was a bit salty for my taste. \n\nAs an appetizer we ordered the Chicken Pate. This by far was my favorite for the night. The little pickles and bread they served with the Pate complimented it just perfectly. \n\nFor the entree, I had the filet mignon which was tender and flavorful but not the best filet I've had. The sauce was pretty good and I enjoyed myself. \n\nTop this off with a glass of Merlot and good company - recipe for a wonderful evening. I would definitely bring some friends back here for dinner again. I'll have to try other items on their menu but I'm definitely ordering the Pate again!"

I ordered a Tom Collins to drink, and it was garnished with a cherry, slice of lime, and piece of hair. Lovely. Then came my chicken club. I had asked my server what the sandwich consisted of, and he was not too sure what came on it. Sadly, not much. Toasted bread, as little chicken as possible, and a couple pieces of bacon and a leaf or two of lettuce. Oh, and no mayonnaise on it. This thing was dry as the desert itself. And the 'pom frites' may as well be called potato chip crumbs. Yuck. I usually like to gives a restaurant I didn't enjoy another chance to redeem itself, but I will not be doing that with this place. Eat at Earl of Sandwich instead."

Order the chicken liver mousse and eat it w/ the bread, I promise you won't regret it!  The quiche is the go-to fave for me.  Frangria's worth trying especially if you're doing an early brunch.  Chicken broccoli crepe is good also.  The tuna special open face sandwich was delish as well.  \n\nService is always pleasant and food always comes out quickly.

It's a little spendy, which is to be expected for any restaurant on the strip, but if you can manage to get an outdoor seat it's well worth it.

We are seated in the Pavilion which was really nice and fun (very romantic too), reminds me of Dubai restaurants. I ordered the french onion soup which I am dying to try; it was very good, but I honestly don't think it was the best I have had, maybe it was my cup, but there was really a lot of cheese, I mean do not get me wrong, I LOVE CHEESE, but there was almost more cheese than onion broth!!!! I swear I could feel my thighs expand with each spoon of cheesy soup!!! For lunch entree I had the Warm chicken & Bree sandwich which was OK!! nothing out of the ordinary. My husband ordered the cream of mushroom (i think thats the name) which was delicious. And for lunch he had the Quiche Lorraine which was really really really buttery. My husband is not a difficult man to please when it comes to food. He never leaves a plate with food on it.  Today was the first time seeing him barely touch his plate! I am not sure if it was the eggs or the butter or the crust being even triple buttered as well, it just was not good! You can say that I am a harsh critic, but my God my husband didn't finish it!!! I could not even swallow the bite I tried!!!! I had high hopes after reading all the yelp reviews! I wish it was better, maybe the steak would have been a safer order which was his original thought but poor thing he figured he would try something different!!! LOVE THE BREAD STICK though and the atmosphere."

  "text" : "I hate writing reviews about Strip restaurants because I'm just 1 out of a 1000 reviews. But I felt strongly enough about my last visit to waste some time venting here. \n\n7:30am on a brisk Saturday morning, I found myself crossing town on the way home from a night of a carousing. As I've been known to do on such nights, I decided it would be a fine time to indulge in a nice breakfast. Being that the weather was particularly tolerable for February, I decided to bask in it & dine on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi. I've enjoyed my similar visits in the past. Sure, the food isn't as good as Bouchon, but while it's not cheap, it's not quite as expensive, and the smoking-friendly patio has been enough to make up for any culinary shortcomings. So what happens when you disturb that equation? As it turns out, those pluses aren't strong enough to carry the place.\n\nThere were two things in particular that chapped my ass. Firstly, there was the construction team out working or surveying or whatever on the patio. I got there pretty close to opening, and hey, the works gotta get done sometime. But the incessant pacing back & forth, discussion, and ladder-arranging turned out to be disturbing enough to aggravate my otherwise saintly patience. Being that I'm such a nice guy, by the time I'd had enough the place started filling up, so the construction team was forced out by necessity, so I never had to speak up. I was distracted enough by everything that I didn't notice how filthy my water glass was. I'm not the kind of guy to bitch about things like that, but it was bad enough that I didn't feel out of place for asking for another glass. I explained what happened to the waiter, and he quickly replaced my glass. I continued on with my meal, and as I was done I picked up my water to find that the new one was just as bad as the first. Now, you would think that when someone - right or wrong - brings up a complaint like that the staff would spend the extra 30 seconds it would take to find the shiniest glass in the rack. Not at Mon Ami Gabi! By this point I was done eating, so I decided to just mention it to the waitress when she asked how everything was. Well, that opportunity never presented itself (which is a problem unto itself in my opinion). \n\nAm I nitpicking? Maybe. But Mon Ami Gabi is by no means cheap, and their food is not so spectacular that it makes up for everything else. And sure, breakfast is considered a \"lesser\" meal at places like this, but that doesn't mean they get a pass on anything that happens before noon. A year ago this would've given them a 4 star review. Maybe I'll try again and see if I caught them on an off day."

Also, the service was just ok.  I told my server I did not want the whip cream with my pancake, not b/c of calories, just because I don't like whip cream that much, fresh or otherwise.  He insisted that I have it because I \"haven't tried theirs\".  Um, ok I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the country and I'm pretty sure I have tasted great whip cream.  It came, I tasted some with my fork (average) and then when he came by at the end of our meal, he insisted that I I had not tasted any and preceded to inspect my cream!  It was just really annoying.

Not the cafe(s), nor the buffet, and now add Mon Ami Gabi to the list.  \n\nI've been staying at this hotel/casino for 5 days (Thanks for the Comp Red Room, Paris!).  Our last night here so I thought I'd give this place a try.  I was hugely disappointed at my meal.  We were seated in the 'Atrium Room' with direct view of Bellagio Fountain.  Yes, it was nice but I came here for the food.  There is a door opened out to the outdoor seating area and the constant chill wind which cools the food very fast was not 'cool'.  \n\nThe Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (celery root remoulade, gribiche sauce) was really average.  I'm glad it was grilled and not deep fried. \n\nThe Butter Lettuce & Honey Apple Crisp Salad (roasted beets, aged goat cheese, apple cider vinaigrette)  was also forgettable.  I could barely taste the dressing.  \n\nThe Roast Chicken & Frites ( all-natural roasted half chicken, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions) - oh pleeeaaasssee!  Costco's Rotisserie chicken had more flavor than this.  It was dry and tasteless!\n\nThe Filet Mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) which is their signature dish and you would think it should stand out!  First of all, I ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  The sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.  But after about 3 bites, I had to trade it with my fiance for his Roast Chicken which was even worse!  \n\nAnd those FRITES, what the hell were those?  String potato chips?  You could have served it with FRENCH fries and that would have been better.  \n\nService was friendly but I wouldn't say it was attentive.  The waiter was more interested in talking to his fellow servers than to his guests.  \n\nIt's food like this that reminds me of why I don't care for French restaurants!"

This time we had the fish of the day, Atlantic char. Light, flavorful, balanced nicely with spinach and potatoes.  Scallop appetizer was delicious, could have had more scallops. Steak bordelaise got rave reviews. A little too much salt on the chicken paillard.  Washed it down with champagne chilled exactly right. Gabi just puts me and friends in a happy, contented state for hours. What more can you ask?"

You can't beat the view - the Bellagio fountains are immediately across the street.   \n\nEverything I've ever eaten here has been fabulous, from the atypical fish and chips to the mussels to the croque monsieur to the french onion soup. Full bar, wine, beer, etc. Great Frangria (their version of Sangria) - buy a carafe to get a better deal... Excellent people watching on the strip. The Atrium room is also a very nice place to sit, but I'd avoid the rest of the place as it is very dark. They've just added a bunch of gas heaters on the patio, so there are no excuses not to enjoy the patio, even on the cooler nights."

Bigger parties, make a reservation  or wait 45 minutes. \n\nI had the Steak Frites Classique and the meat was really good. The \"frites\" which in French means fries were actually more like fries/chips...I was looking forward to the fries I grew up eating in France (they do taste differently than McDonald's!) unfortunately they have their special fries I guess. They were good but I was expecting something else.\nMy friend had the chicken and fries, and the chicken was good but not exceptional. I would definitely recommend getting the steak, it's their specialty I think. \n\nA bit on the pricey side, with 3 small cheeses on a plate for $15.00! And the cocktail/ drink are on average $15.00 too so if you can wait..dine here but drink somewhere else. \nService was great, they check on you but not too much that you want to tell your waiter ' here's $5.00 if you leave me alone for the rest of my dinner!'. \n\nBut overall despite the prices the food overall was definitely a 4, the service was a 5 and the atmosphere was also a 5. No music too loud etc..good setting and if you eat on the terrace you have a view on the Bellagio Fountain."

We got there around 9:30ish and got seated outside right away. Not 10 minutes later there was a line waiting for tables outside.\n\nWe shared the cornbeef hash with poached eggs, which was very good, but having it served in a bowl-ish pooled up the oil in the dish. The wife got the bacon/chocolate waffles which is by far more tasty than a crepe. Served with syrup, fresh whip cream, and chocolate sauce.\n\nAll very tasty and all for around 1 entrance into the buffet."

Sadly the only view we had was of the street performer outside. You know, those creepy statue men that come to life??\n\nAll the candles around the restaurant gives it a very romantic vibe. I felt out of place because everyone around us were, well, senior citizen status hahaha. \n\nWe ordered soups to start. I got the ONION SOUP, which is like WOW MORE PLEASE!! Best french onion soup I've ever had in my life!! The portion was pretty generous, and it was half cheese (YAY CHEESE! =] ). Perfect flavor, perfect proportions of broth, onion, bread, and cheese. I could've had 10 of these! Bf ordered the SOUP DU JOUR, which was some sort of creamy bisque type thing, maybe potato? His soup was good too, and he actually liked it more than mine. If this was a soup review, I'd give it 5 stars hands down!!\n\nFor entrees, we both got steak-frites. They were not satisfying at all. The steak was very thin and flat; we're not really fans of flat iron steaks. And they were cooked a little more than the medium-rare we ordered. I got the STEAK ROQUEFORT, which comes with a blue cheese sauce and fries. He got the STEAK BORDELAISE with its carmelized onions and red wine sauce. I preferred the onions and his sauce more than the blue cheese. The frites super thin, like onion straws. There was no potato substance at all, it tasted like pieces of fried..nothing? Sad.\n\nLater that night, we had a 5 dollar steak which we enjoyed more than the 25 dollar steaks at Mon Ami Gabi."

The waffle was satisfying but it wasn't the best waffle I've had. (Bouchon chicken and waffles are still my favorite.) The hubby opted for the savory dish which consisted of his favorite item: corned beef hash. Luckily for me, I taught my hubby to eat poached eggs and that was also included on top of the hash.

On the specials menu, the Alaskan char was described as somewhere between salmon and trout. Luckily I love both.  It had the flavor of a mild lean salmon filet but the texture of buttery trout.  Served over a potato leek puree, it was delightful.  The portion was enough for two people, but I managed to finish it all.  The garlic spinach was nothing to write home (or here) about.  Sadly, no room for dessert.  The waiter had perfect timing, and was unhurried, friendly, gracious, and helpful.\n\nSitting on the patio, the fountains across the street provided spectacular visuals.  In between the choreographed water art, people-watching took center stage.\n\nMy only criticism was the hostesses were a little snotty and the bar service was a bit disorganized.  Arrived about 15 minutes late and they acted very irritated and wouldn't promise seating.  Waited another 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention.  Finally, the restrooms on the casino floor (there were none in the restaurant) were trashed with broken fixtures, paper and garbage everywhere, and a long line.  \n\nRegardless, I would go back in a heartbeat.\nBon appetit!"

  "text" : "A wonderful little restaurant with an unassuming facade, you could literally just walk by it and not even realize what you're missing.\n\nWe came to the Paris in hopes of hitting up the famous buffet at Le Village but when we walked all the way there, we saw that the line to get in was even longer than to ride on Space Mountain.\n\nPass.\n\nAnd after a night of binge drinking, my boyfriend and I decided that we didn't really want to do the buffet thing anyway. We were way too hungry and lazy and to be honest, just wanted to sit our asses down and be served. So we walked around looking for other places to dine that weren't so packed when we discovered this cute little restaurant hiding in the corner. \n\nWe got an amazing table outside on the patio on the most gorgeous Vegas day. It was already a fantastic start to a delicious meal. The service was great too. Our waitress was very cute and so friendly, she made us feel right at home. \n\nWe started with their Fruit Bouquet, which I had seen on several other tables. It was a beautifully carved cantaloupe filled with melon, grapes and pineapple that came with sides of creme fraiche, mint syrup and brown sugar. YUM. A perfect way to start breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and the little accompaniments paired perfectly. I personally loved the pineapple with the mint syrup and the cantaloupe with the creme fraiche. \n\nFor our entrees my bf chose the Egg, Bacon & Cheese crepe with some added avocado on top. I chose the special Benedict of the day which came with spinach, tomato and bacon on a toasted sourdough muffin with a chive hollandaise. We also had to get a side order of the frites, they just looked so good!\n\nEverything was absolutely delicious. The crepe was perfectly cooked, really melted in your mouth. The cheese was chewy while the crepe was delicate, and the egg and bacon rounded all the flavors out very nicely. The avocado that my bf added also was a nice touch!\nMy benedict was very good, the eggs were cooked perfectly which is a huge plus. Almost every benedict I get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny. Mmm! They weren't kidding about the 'toasted' muffin though. Mine was definitely a little more well-done than I would have liked but it was still yummy. I loved the muffin because it had a really distinct sourdough taste that went well with the rest of the Benedict flavors. \n\nThe frites were also tasty. We could barely finish just one order because it was so big. Don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless. Keep in mind though these are not typical fries, they are very thinly cut and fried until crispy then topped with a good amount of salt. If you like really crispy potatoes then you will love these. Otherwise, if you want regular french fries don't bother. \n\nDefinitely a great experience for both of us and we were both so lucky to come on such a beautiful day. Will definitely try to come back next time I'm in town!"

The view is spectacular from the patio (we always get patio seating here) and a great place to just sit and people watch.  \n\nMy husband and I dined here for about 3 hours just \"noshing\" on several different appetizers plus drinks.  This is a great way to spend the afternoon and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious.  We both had the soup du jour which was LOBSTER BISQUE. It was truly wonderful but we ordered a shot of sherry for the soup, which to our disappointment should have been in the soup to begin with.  Not a big deal since everything else was over the top.\n\nWe went back for dinner and sat on the patio again.  And again, the food was memorable as was the ambience.\n\nMore recently 2 of my friends and I had lunch here and we all loved it so much we've decided to make this our favorite lunch spot.\n\nOne ordered the LEMON THYME SALMON.  She said it was the best salmon she'd ever had and I had to agree.  It was just a bit rare in the center which is what it's supposed to be and the lemon thyme flavor shone through.  \n\nThe other One ordered a steak, done medium rare and she said it was perfect.  I didn't taste the steak but she loved it.\n\nI ordered one of my favorite dishes TROUT GRENOBLAISE.  Wow.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The sides we ordered were shared and there wasn't a thing we could find to complain about here.\n\nService was a little on the slow side but it was crowded and we were in no hurry.    If you want patio seating next to the railing you need to get there just before they open so you can be seated among the first.  It's worth it just to sit and watch the fountains and the throngs of people walking by.   Take your time here."

Basically every steak just comes with frites, and there are limited other options.  I had the filet which was really good.  Only complaint I heard all night was that the lobster tail add-on was pretty small and thus not worth it.  They give everyone fresh French bread when you sit down, which was amazing.

We were first at the city center restaurants and everything seemed pretty pricey so of course I yelped restaurants in the area and came across this one. The prices were like a normal restaurant. About $15 a plate. There was a wait for the outdoor area so we just decided to sit inside. The food was good, in my opinion but the others I was with thought it could be better. The other reviews complimented the waiters but ours wasn't that great. We had to ask a busboy for help. It's all good cuz we took it out of his tip :)"

It was too much and too rich for him and he threw up! But he really liked the onion soup! I had the seafood crepe. I can tell the shrimp was really fresh because I had allergic reaction after eating it (allergy to fresh shrimp).\nIt was good though; especially the sauce and there were peas inside the crepe. I thought the shrimp and scallop would be inside the crepe but it was actually outside."

The prices are very reasonable, particularly for Vegas standards and the patio is a great place to sit and enjoy a meal. \n\nOn the minus side, the wait staff is frazzled, so you won't get the attention you should, and the dining room is cramped and very noisy (again, bistro/brasserie style). Still, one of our musts every time we end up in Vegas."

We sat near it. You order whatever vodka you want and they bring you a huge glass of it. You then take this glass and bring it over to the Bloody Mary Bar. You can choose tomato juice or clamato juice... you can then add an assortment of olives, there are pickled beans, fresh horseradish... oh and they have pepperoni sticks. I saw people walking away with their glasses filled to the brim and with side plates filled with extras. \n\nAfter placing our order with our wonderful waiter, he brought us soft baguettes with butter. Our waiter was so friendly and so engaging. He was fairly attentive for a busy Sunday. He made suggestions and knew a lot about the menu. He also brought me refills of coke without me even having to ask. \n\nWe got there during brunch, but I had lunch. Hmm, while my friends ate burgers, eggs benny and corned beef hash, I had the country pate and the warm frisee salad with bacon. Sigh. I could have sat here all day. The pate was really good. It was firm and the top was covered in bacon. It came with some toast, cornichons and a big dollop of grainy mustard. I didn't really need the mustard and shamefully ate most of the pate with my fork. Yum yum. My frisee salad was nicely tossed with the right amount of vinaigrette. I love the soft, runny poached egg. I love breaking that yolk and seeing the golden thickness coat the curly lettuce. Oh, and there is bacon. Yes, and lots of it."

Steak is definitely their specialty but not the only one, the seafood is also pretty amazing as proven by my boyfriend's sea bass daily special.\n\nWe started the meal with a small amusebouche, bread and butter, and the baked brie. The honey coupled with the roasted garlic made the brie a winner. Next came my steak, the best filet I've ever eaten, and it simply and perfectly came with Mon Ami Gabi's famous French fries. Being a French restaurant, we of course stayed for dessert and ordered the creme brûlée and a macchiato. \n\nFor the quality and deliciousness of the food, friendly and attentive service, and atmosphere, this is one of the best deals and best kept secret on The Strip! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it is a little cramped, and there aren't any restrooms inside the restaurant (my boyfriend and I felt people were walking on top of us the whole time, and you have to go outside into the casino's restroom if you have to go). Besides that, it is still my favorite place to eat and I am definitely coming back!"

I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was \"just okay.\"  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  \n\nThe bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!

  "text" : "I was quite excited when I learned that Mon Ami Gabi served breakfast and brunch. We had eaten here, years ago, for lunch and dinner - and both were good experiences.\n\nEven though it was a little chilly, we opted to have our Saturday breakfast outside on the patio (they have heaters). The menu looked great. I appreciated that they offered some non-breakfast items (french onion soup, spinach salad, etc.) in addition to the more typical breakfast items. The breakfast items ranged from omelettes to chocolate and bacon waffles to sweet and savory crepes.\n\nWe decided to play it somewhat safe and go with an omelette. I liked that their omelettes had what felt like a French-twist (brie, etc.). When our omelette arrived, everything looked delectable. The omelette came with hash browns, green beans (yeah, green beans), and toasted bread. We also ordered a side of bacon. \n\nThe omelette was very light and fluffy - cooked perfectly. While it had a lot of spinach, I tasted little cheese. And despite being advertised as \"spinach and green vegetables\", it was just spinach. 2 stars. The green beans (seriously, green beans) were outstanding. I don't know what they were cooked in (there seemed to be a hint of garlic?), but they were awesome. 5 stars. The hash browns were also great. Good balance of crispy and soft - and there were a lot of flavors going on. Definitely no need for hot sauce or ketchup or anything. 4 stars. The bacon looked amazing, but was a bit of a let down. The glaze was incredible, but the bacon itself wasn't crisp enough (despite the menu calling it \"crispy bacon\") and was too fatty. 2 stars.\n\nThe drinks were nothing special. The mimosa was just your standard mimosa. The bloody mary bar (they bring you the glass and vodka, you visit the ingredient station and create your own drink) was pretty eh. They had standard bloody mary mixes in ice, ok selection of hot sauces, no worcestershire sauce, not enough tongs for everything, etc. 2 stars.\n\nI so want to give this place 4 stars, but based on our particular meal, I just can't. However, the service and ambiance are definitely 4 stars. And I think we may just have ordered the wrong thing. As we were walking out, we were both drooling over some of the plates at the other tables. We will definitely be back here for breakfast / brunch and hope to eat something better."

There are so many restaurants where it's easily $100/person, and who knows if it's really going to be worth it. Coming from SF bay area we get plenty of good eats, and I hate forking out a ton of money for average food and a \"me too\" environment. \n\nThis place was oozing cuteness, and personality. Like a vibrant french cafe.  The service was very good, attentive, helpful. The food was great.  We had the english pea soup special which was absolutely great, and I had the scallops, hubby had the skate wing. Both were delish but the scallops were best. You get 5 huge scallops and lots of veggies for like $20. The quality of the food ingredients and freshness of the seafood was apparent, and it was such a good value. We each had 2 glasses of wine and were out of there for like $100 or so.  Would definitely recommend this place for dinner (and I bet brunch would be great too!)."

  "text" : "Eating dinner at the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant was one of the highlights of my Vegas vacation.  The dinner prices were extremely affordable (especially considering the location and the pricing of other nearby restaurants) and the food was excellent.  Each couple in our group had to pay $100, but this included 2 bottles of wine (approximately $64).  You can't really get much better bang for the buck on the Las Vegas strip.  I will say that the Sea Scallops were perfectly cooked and my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  The escargot was also very tasty (although I am admittedly not an expert on that particular appetizer).  And of course, as you will see from other reviews, the views from the patio (where we ate) are spectacular.  Not only do you get amazing views of the Bellagio fountains, but you also get spectacular views of the heart of the Vegas strip.  This would be an ideal place to bring a date or loved one, as the location is about as romantic as it gets.  It was a tad bit cold at night when we went, but the outside heaters helped a little (although if you sit near the street you will be outside the range of the heaters).  The one slight downside is that it did take a while for our food to come to our table, although to be fair they were jam packed.  Highly recommended and I would definitely go back again on my next trip to Vegas!"

It topped the trip off perfectly as we spent the afternoon eating and chatting away at a window side table in this little bistro! I was thankful we got indoor seating since the weather had been really windy outside!\n\nFor Hors D'Oeurves we had:  Escargots de Bourgogne\nThis was a bit against my will but group majority prevailed. My previous encounter with snails were not pleasant but I decided to give them another shot. Honestly I couldn't really taste much of it as it was masked in the garlic herb sauce. It was just a chewy bit of something that I swallowed down. I liked to dip the baguette into the garlic herb sauce tho that was really yum-O. \n\nEntree: Trout Grenobloise\nI liked the flakiness of the fish.The pan-sear or however the skin was prepared was great. It was very crispy! It was mildly seasoned and hinted at the fish's natural flavor which was good. Overall i really liked it. It was light and the green beans that came with it were cooked nicely. \n\nSo there was the frites that came along in a cup and they were super yummy and quite addicting. Thinner than fries and maybe even than potato chips.\n\nat Last!1! time for Dessert!: Profiterole Trio A.K.A Cream puffs! \nThey were super good!!! It was napoleon style as we had vanilla, chocolate and strawberry filled centers. I loved the chocolate/ fudge sauce that was drizzled on them. The flavors were very concentrated and they put me to shame to the kind of cream puffs I had made in HS french class. Much better than Beard Papa too that has commercialized and supersized the cream puff. \n\nI def loved the atmosphere of this place and though it's on the pricier side, its a treat to come here with friends and check it out for one of the fancier meals one can have in Vegas."

And we did this time! \nWe were there for lunch, requested an outdoor table because the weather was great and the view was good. We were told the wait time was 30 minutes and were given a vibrator to come back later. As we walked away from the restaurant, one of the receptionist called my name and said a table was ready for us now. We were surprised and happy that we did not need to wait. I found this interesting drink on the menu called \"Frangria\" and ordered a jar. It was like a French-style Sangria and it was good. My sister and mom did not enjoy it much but the drink was great to start my day. We liked the bread they served. It was hot and fresh. We ordered a Prime Rib sandwich, a Chicken and Brie sandwich, and a Seafood Crepe. Prime Rib sandwich was good. Its meat was very tender and juicy. Chicken and Brie was a little sweet, perhaps the sweetness was from the apple slices? I liked my Seafood Crepe. Shrimps and scallops were big, juicy, and cooked to perfection. However, the sauce was a little too plain and they could have put things other than green peas inside the crepe. For each plate, it came with a tiny side salad and I really like the salad dressing. We did not order dessert because our entrees were very fulfilling. I will definitely go back again because this place is perfect for a relaxing morning."

We made the mistake of coming here for the brunch food, which was on par with Denny's.\n\nIt was a 45 minute wait for a table outside on a Saturday at 11am so we sat inside instead. We were seated near the entrance. The dining room was too dark. The tables were way too close together, other diners stepped all over us trying to sit down, and we didn't want to hear their NASCAR and Budweiser conversation.\n\nOur waiter took our orders, served our food, and checked once to make sure everything was okay. Other than that, he was completely forgettable. Oh, except that he corrected wifey's pronunciation of crêpe as \"crape\". *POP* goes the sound of the pretend-we're-in-Paris bubble.\n\nOur main complaint was the food, it was uniformly bad.\n\nThe crêpe was served floating in a grainy béchamel sauce that tasted like raw flour and pretty much ruined it.\n\nThe Croque Madame egg was overcooked (no runny yolk), cheese was congealed, and toast was dry.\n\nOur brunch came with a generous serving of french fries so thin they were nearly potato chips, and they were pretty tasty.\n\nThe make-your-own Bloody Mary bar is genius and delicious, there's tons of fresh and pickled veggies, different stuffed olives, and different hot sauces to choose from. I would have liked a larger glass to get more good stuff in there, 1 shot of vodka and some ice filled half the glass. There was hardly any room to put all the goodies in.

It was described as \"oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter.\" It was decent. NOT enough butter for my taste and a bit too much garlic. However, dipping the hard bread in the sauce was still okay. Unless you're really craving for escargot, I'd pass on this dish.\n\nI ordered the Prime Steak Sandwich cooked Medium w/au jus, mustard mayo, caramelized onions ($13.95) and that came with their \"signature hand-cut frites.\"  I think I should have ordered this medium-rare because the steak was not as tender as I would like. Overall, it was a simple sandwich and the sauces complimented well. Their frites were definitely different from what I'm use to. Like most of the reviewers have said, these are borderline potato chips! My friend and I kept calling them a TEASE.

We sat on the patio and watched the sun go down.  Keep in mind this place has MONEY locale for its great view of the Bellagio fountain show.  It's a little blocked by palm tress but its as good as its going to get for not standing in front of it. Plus this gives you something to do while you watch it.\n\nEveryone ordered steaks while I ordered a Lemon-Thyme Seared Salmon with orzo, peas, leeks, spinach, lemon butter.  The salmon was cooked well but it was...salmon.  Most places don't usually do a lot with salmon but it was plated with a very nice creamy orzo and vegetables. It was a good combination because it brought a little more to the salmon.  Overall though, the orzo and vegetables still stood out over the salmon.\n\nAll in all, Mon Ami Gabi makes nice food at a reasonable price for Vegas.

The atmosphere is quite cozy and chic. It is quite busy so service wasn't terrible but not as good as it could've been. \n\nI ordered the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Skate Wing. I had not had escargot in a really long time, so I HAD to try it but it was quite a disappointment. The garlic herb sauce for the escargot was extremely buttery to the point where I could feel the butter after wiping my mouth. Definitely not appealing. And the escargot was a bit on the chewy side. When the skate wing arrived the aroma was intoxicating. The texture was very light (similar to a tilapia type fish) and the flavors wasn't too overwhelming. I was not a fan of the capers (a bit on the tart side which was a little off putting with the dish) that came with the fish. The chips (made in-house) were extremely de-lish! Probably would buy a whole bag if I could.\n\nFor fish, this place is fantastic. Great atmosphere. Would definitely want to go back to try some other dishes as I'm a huge fan of french cuisine."

House wine was reasonably priced and good (though I am not a connoisseur) and the warm loaf of French bread was delectable. French onion soup was rich with no shortage of onions or cheese.  I had the Beef Bourginon which was excellent. My wife's prime rib was huge, tender, and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied by creamy scalloped potatoes and al dente green beans. We each took 1/2 home for lunch tomorrow. By Vegas standards, the prices were reasonable, as we got out at under $100. We will return next time we're in town."

  "text" : "I have been traveling to Vegas since the mid 90's at least 2 or 3X a year for business and pleasure, and nothing compares to a meal at Mon Ami Gabi! Hands down this is one of my favorite places to dine when I am in town, and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed. This classic French bistro serves magnificent food in a wonderful atmosphere, and at a fair price. Thier position on the strip also offers a terrific view of the Bellagio.\n\nAs soon as I boarded my flight from NY this morning my mouth was drooling with anticipation. Thier steak frites are absolutely amazing, and will melt in your mouth with orgasmic bliss. I knew that I would be dining alone tonight, so I did not even make a reservation as the bar area is a great spot to eat here, especially the one out facing the strip with a view of the Bellagio water show. I just winged it and ended up with a prime spot sitting and conversing with other single visitors in town enjoying a meal at the bar.\n\nI ordered  a glass of Pinot Noir, and chose the Steak Frites Bordelaise. Tender steak sliced thin, almost like a flank steak, with carmelized onions, and a red wine sauce ladeled over the top. Crispy and thin frites with just the right amount of saltiness accompanied the steak. I bit into the first bite and - OH -MY-GOD - I wanted to melt off my bar stool right then and there. The exquisite taste of the steak along with the carmelized onions just put a smile on my face the whole time I was there. I think everyone around me had the same look of satisfaction from what they were eating too. I went absolutely all piggy and finished every bite of steak and frites on the plate. I even soaked up the extra sauce on the plate with this amazing hot mini baguette of crispy bread they serve with the meal.\n\nIt was all so good I totally ignored the booming sounds of the water show going on across the street. As I settled up the bill I was glowing in the aftermath of total satisfaction. Just a perfect place to have a great meal in a civilized atmosphere wether it be a date or a group. As I walked down the street back towards my casino hotel I felt as if I was floating two inches above the ground. Drool is already forming at the corner of my mouth writing this review!"

No offense but the decorum of the restaurant totally gives off a vibe of a good classy time, but the food just doesn't measure up. \n\nOrdered the roasted chicken and fritas, the chicken came out too dry. Its a roasted herb chicken, every italian, american restaurant serves some version of this--so you can only manage my disappointment when they screw this up. It was too bland and to sort of juice/sauce component to go with the chicken. \n\nDo not get the trout. If you eat a lot of seafood, you will be able to tell instantly the fish is not up to par. The trout came out thin and too over dressed with the lemon and capers. Capers is incredibly overpowering thereby masking any fresh seafood taste this dish might have had. \n\nThe Beef Bourguignon is also another version of beef stew, if that tickles your fancy. \n\nBread came in paper bags... enough said. \n\nService: moderate, there were times where it was impossible to flag down a waiter/ess."

Across from the Bellagio and it's dancing fountains. Quintessential Las Vegas views down the boulevard in either direction. The patio of Mon Ami Gabi is truly the epicenter of Las Vegas.\n\nThe decor is that of a Parisian French bistro one would find on the holodeck of the Starship Enterprise. Almost too perfect. But certainly very nice.\n\nThe service was also very good. No real complaints.\n\nSo why two stars? Because the food SUCKS and they know it. And they don't care.\n\nBut the view from the patio at night is so compelling. It is worth the mediocre food. It really is. But gee, this place could be SO much more. So as a restaurant it gets 2 stars. But for a one-time reasonably priced dinner for a tourist, that patio view is worth the price of admission."

Made reservations thru opentable unfortunately since patio seating is on a first come first serve basis we did not get to enjoy the Bellagio fountains while dining. \n\nAs soon as we were seated we were given a loaf of french bread in a bag which we all thought was delicious so good that we asked for another. It was a ladies weekend out so we decided to share a few things so as not to get too full. Our order between the 4 of us: half order of mussels, asparagus soup, 2 Beef Bourguignons. I've been dying to try Beef Bourguignon only because I saw it in the movie Julia & Julia and it looked so good, if you're a fan of a hearty and flavourful beef stew I suggest you try this. \n\nIt's a good thing I only ordered half of the mussels because I wouldn't have been able to finish a full order. I even shared with the other girls and we still couldn't polish it off, but it was definitely tasty. So tasty that I even took some of the bread and used it to sop up some of the broth, YUM! Both the Beef Bourguignon & asparagus soup were also good (which was the special of the day) I like this place so much that I want to take bf here when we come together. \n\nUnfortunately for girls ready to go to a club and dressed in heels the floor was pretty slippery. There were a few times that my heart skipped a beat because I slipped a bit. At first I thought I was the only one that noticed it. But when we were seated and I mentioned it to the girls they also had the same problem. I even had those grips on my shoes and I still slid, so be careful."

The food, staff, and atmosphere are unmatched anywhere in Vegas and truly reminded me of being in Paris FR. .

We sat inside, but still, the ambiance was there. The service very attentive, quick, and the server had great recommendations and favorites. We had:\n\nSteak Bearnaise - tender, Great sauce, excellent pommes frites\nBeef Bourguignon - tender beef, wonderful sauce, buttered noodles (YUM)\nBurger - Good, came with pommes frites\n\nOverall a good place to go for lunch/dinner. I would definitely recommend making a reservation so as to not wait, and again, get there early for a chance to sit outside and admire the passerby's and weather. We definitely wanted to come back here, but with such a short visit it makes for a good first night dinner to set the tone for your trip. They are known for their steak, their tender, flavorful steak. Have someone at your table try one if they like to share, or order one each and compare."

(We were told that a couple of our group could go early to the restaurant and put our parties name down for the patio and then wait for the rest of our group to come at the reserved time). This type of customer service does a disservice to a restaurant that normally would have rated a 5 stars. Either tell your customers that something is not possible up front, or allow for special situations when they arise and be flexible. \n     It was not the way we wanted to start our dining experience."

Overall, food was OK, but definitely a bit overboard in sodium content.  Most of the dishes were great for the first few bites, but quickly became too rich / too salty.  \n\nIndoor seating is also extremely dark / stuffy (perhaps an interior remodel, additional lights, new furniture, etc. would help).

My God, the bread.  They give you a mini-baguette of hot French bread (free) with butter and a little plate of vinegary shredded vegetables. (We were given one plate of apple slaw, and one plate of carrot.  Both were good.)  The bread is heaven, and they didn't even make a face when we asked for more!\n\nWe ordered the warm brie appetizer, onion soup, caesar salad, crab cake, and a side of frites.  As a vegetarian, I was a bit worried there wouldn't be enough options for me, but there were plenty.  They have salads, soups, and a variety of vegetarian sides (like mac and cheese, which I will be getting next time), along with a \"vegetable platter\" entree - doesn't sound very awesome, but who knows.\n\nThe brie was amazing.  I will be recreating it at home shortly.  Warm brie with honey, cracked black pepper, and roasted garlic cloves.  Perfection.\n\nThe onion soup was also good, my only complaint is that it was too cheesy.  Sure, I love cheese, but I'd like some soup with my soup too.\n\nCaesar salad was nothing special, and at $8, I won't be ordering it again.  I know, I know, Caesar salads generally aren't special.  I mean, what can you do with lettuce, croutons, and dressing?  You can add capers, for one thing, as I do at home.  And, this salad was over-dressed.  Not horrible, but not worth it.\n\nMy old man said the crab cake was the best he'd ever had, and he has tried crab cakes at many-a-restaurant.\n\nThe frites = In-N-Out fry shnivelings.  And yes, that is a good thing.   They are AWESOME, a must-order!\n\nThe service was quick and friendly, the wait was correctly quoted (30 minutes on a Sunday night), and the prices were reasonable.  The whole meal, including tax and tip, was only $60 (plus our two free loaves of bread....).  Nice!"

Ironically/coincidentally, he became quite friendly and talkative at the end of the meal after we asked for the check.\n\nWe were served freshly baked mini baguettes and a creamy butter. We also asked for some jam that seemed to be freshly made strawberry jam. All of the above were quite good.\n\nWe ordered shrimp cocktail, a tuna salad dish, corned beef hash with poached egg, and brioche french toast with blueberries and macerated blueberry sauce.\n\nI was told the tuna salad was not fresh and barely edible. I personally ate the corned beef hash with a poached egg and the aforementioned french toast. I'd give the CB hash a 3.5; it was a bit mushy for me, I prefer to have my CB hash to be crisped in the pan to provide some texture and also to be seasoned a bit more. After adding some salt, pepper, and tabasco it was closer to a 4 star dish. The poached egg was OK, but not perfectly poached as so few ever are; would've preferred it to be a bit runnier.\n\nThey used a nice thick brioche bread for the french toast, dipped it in a light custard before cooking. Topped it with a very light vanilla whipped cream and blueberries. Then served it with their macerated blueberry sauce (which is listed as maple syrup on their website's menu, but has no maple taste to it at all). I REALLY enjoyed this french toast, with the blueberry sauce it wasn't overly sweet. In fact, it was barely sweet at all. This french toast and the one stuffed with vanilla bean custard and fresh raspberries at Bellagio Cafe are the 2 best in town.\n\nIf I was writing a review purely on the french toast here, I would give them 5 stars...but since I have to take everything else in to account they get a 4 for now until I try something else. I will definitely be back to eat the french toast again."

The baguette in the bag was delicious and came accompanied by both butter as well as a yummy carrot compote.  The caesar salad was simple yet quite delicious.  But their famous steak frites are simply to die for.  I had the steak bordelaise, which came smothered in sweet caramelized onions and a red wine reduction, together with a mountain of frites that looked like shredded homemade potato chips -- airy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

We chose this place because of all the good reviews here, but we were definitely not impressed at all.  The food was mediocre but definitely compares to Denny's status with a marked up price.  The presentation wasn't even that great.  I had the ham and cheese omlette and my bf had the mushroom omlette and added chicken, which was very dry.  The ham on my omlette wasn't even \"fancy\" ham it's regular sandwich had from the grocery store.  The omlette menu was very simple and not a lot of options.  On a good note the hashbrowns were good and I might go back and try the crepes maybe that's there best dish."

  "text" : "The location takes the cake for this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant on the strip.  I would highly recommend a reservation; the downside is you can't get a reservation for the patio - the best patio on the Strip - so that's a long wait if you're wanting to do that.\n\n$260 got the four of us two mid-range bottles of red wine, one salad, four entrees, and one dessert.  I didn't think it was ridiculously overpriced, it's just I would rather eat someplace else.\n\nThe atmosphere was kind of cheesey & touristy, and it was extremely dark in there.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I could barely read the menu.  The first bottle of wine we got was just straight up rancid; once we asked about it, they were quick to replace it.  The French bread and garlic butter was really good to start out with.\n\nI had sea bass, it was just OK.  I think the concensus from the table was everything was just OK.  Maybe I expected more?\n\nOh, except the bread pudding.  The white chocolate bread pudding was amazing."

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, busy but comfortable. saw carrot top and george wallace at a table next to us.  went here for breakfast the next day which again was really good. We had reservations for lunch but did not for breakfast. For lunch we waited about 5 mins to be seated.  People who didn't have reservations were waiting for awhile so make sure to make reservations for lunch especially on the weekends. for breakfast we were seated inside with no reservations, which wasn't that bad, but sitting out in the patio is much better especially on a nice day."

Their outdoor seating is ideal on a beautiful day. \n\nI started with a Caesar salad and my boyfriend had their French Onion soup. The salad was fine but not great, the soup was VERY cheesy. I'm not a big fan of onions, but it was quite tasty. Our starters were good, but I couldn't stop eating their delicious french bread! They also brought us some very good apple and fennel salad. \n\nWe are both steak lovers and we had some of the best steak here. We opted for the filet mignon and it was the most tender steak ever! He ordered the Filet with Merlot butter and I ordered their Filet Mignon Au Poivre. Mine was great, but my boyfriend's steak was even better! Their frites were very good as well. Don't expect fries, they're more like chips. We each had a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany our meals. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered their bread pudding which was moist and delicious and my boyfriend tried their Bananas Foster crepe. We also had their Cafe Gabi. It is coffee with Bailey's, Grand Marnier and Frangelico. Yum!\n\nThis is definitely a place we plan on revisiting. Very soon!"

  "text" : "On a perfectly mild sunny day in vegas, it was a great choice to eat on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. As soon as we entered the restaurant from the casino entrance, from the dark interior, it was like stepping into a whole different world once we got seated on the patio. \nUsually when servers rattle off the specials of the day, it goes out the other ear for me. But after looking over the menu and half heartedly deciding on the spinach and gruyere omlette, I heard the server mention Bacon and Spinach Eggs Benedict and i was sold! Quiche Lorraine with bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=4Ua39HREZlvlYbEf3EP_ew for the dude and my friend got the dish i was thinking of originally http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=5luau0SKUmjSVfXBalxsMQ. We all agreed that my dish ended up being the best: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=T3jPSmE56xcETgTqjegttw.\nThe quiche had a nice crust, but was kind of monotonous. (i love breakfast sides and this had none). The spinach omelette was ok- i enjoyed my omelette at Max Brenner much more. \nI've only had eggs benedict a few times elsewhere and i have to say this one was very yummy- the eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon (i believe it was applewood) was nice and crispy. \nWe were too sweets wasted this time to order the pancakes, french toast etc, so next time i would like to try those or the steak dishes with a side of their onion soup!"

They checked up on us every now and then and refilled my drink every so often. \n\nCons: For the amount you pay, the food was decent. I got a seafood crepe, with basically 3 prawns and 2 scallops and a crepe. It was decent, i barely touched my meal. My friends got a quiche and a steak. They said it was decent as well. Your call.\n\nOverall: It's not a bad place to try if you're up at least $80 :)  lucky for all of us, vegas provides us with that opportunity to gamble huh and win some money! (half-kidding)"

But Alcatraz is for locals too, so don't hate plaYa!!\n\nOne of my favorite brunch spots on the strip.  Actually I've been in Vegas for a little less than a month now, so I don't have too many brunch spots on the strip, but I still love this place.\n\nNice tip:  Also learned this from My T, when you're waiting for your table, there is a bar in the back in the outside area where you can hang out and people watch and enjoy a drink.  This is actually a crucial part of the experience here for me.  \n\nTip #2, you want a table outside.  Inside is a bit boring and I always see the younger crowds outside.\n\nGood food (a bit pricey, but that's how the strip rolls) good people watching and other views like the fountains, this place is cool.  I still would give it 5 stars even though I feel the food is a bit pricey.\n\nRecommendations on food are the salmon salad if you are gonna be a weenie and not want something greasy like me sometimes, or I would go steak frites if you wanna go big.  The fries are crispy which is too annoying.\n\nI have yet to try the onion soup, everyone seems to be raving about it!"

  "text" : "This place was excellent!! I always walk by this place every time I'm in Vegas and we finally decided to try it out for dinner this weekend.  You can make a reservation for the inside portion of the restaurant but the patio dining doesn't take reservations.  We decided that it was a nice evening and there was a cool breeze so we opted to wait it out and have dinner on the patio.  I'm glad we waited, it was really nice having the fountains in front of us throughout dinner and the weather was perfect! They do kind of squeeze you in there but that's understandable and we had a table for four for just the two of us so we had plenty of room.\n\nOne problem I had was that there was some dude with a giant snake standing RIGHT in front of the restaurant the entire time.  He had a microphone and a little speaker and he was trying to charge people to take a picture with him and his snake the whole time....that got annoying real fast.\n\nThe food was excellent!! We started out with a crabcake (they give you one medium sized crabcake) and it was pretty good, definitely not worth the $15 pricetag but I'm glad I tried it.  We shared a cup of the french onion soup too and it was pretty good.  I've never really been a big onion soup fan so I don't have much to compare it too but I heard it was good so we gave it a shot and I thought it was quite tasty.  I had the filet mignon and my fiance had the trout - I liked the filet way better but he said he thought the trout was just as good (I just like steak more than fish).  I really wanted to have dessert but I was just too full from everything else that I had to pass, but I'm sure it would have been delicious though.  I also opted out of having wine with dinner because I had been drinking all day, because you know, it's Vegas.  I'm definitely going to be back next time I'm in town and I'll probably have the filet again (it was just that good)!"

My friend and I went to brunch here on our first morning in Vegas (of this trip) and got seated at a table right away (whew!) despite how busy they were. We got a nice spot right inside the window seating which has a great view of the Bellagio and strip surrounding. They had an eggs benedict special with tomato and spinach that was sooo good. My friend, who introduced me to Mon Ami Gabi from her last trip, repeatedly goes back for the croissant breakfast sandwich. Service was great, food was great, view was great...what's not to love so far?\n\nMy friend gets a little too drunk this night...hey, it's Vegas...and is out of commission for the rest of the following day. I woke-up craving the previous morning's meal and decide to go back on my own. I sat at the bar where Robert was bartending. He was very comical with the wait staff and made the whole experience entertaining, while providing the best service of course! He was very attentive, accommodating & friendly. The meal was excellent as it was the day before, but the service was even better. :) \n\nMy no longer hungover friend came with me to sit at the bar on day three of our trip. Robert was working again, and gave us continual good service. My friend and I tried new entrees at his recommendation that were just as delicious as our favorites. The assistant GM, Clancy, was also extremely professional and offered above and beyond good service. He gave us his special (very tasty!) english muffins for being return customers all trip and even offered me a wisp when I complained of having food in my teeth---how awesome is that!\n\nI highly recommend Mon Ami Gambi for the deeeelicious brunch, above and beyond service, great location, and so much more!! I will definitely go back whenever I return to Vegas."

We got seated and it took a while to get drinks and order taken (about 10-15 minutes). We finally got to order our coffee but we received without a creamer. The gentleman mentioned he would be back but he did not return. We asked a bus boy for the creamer cleaning the other table and he brought us a dirty one with fresh jam all over the bottom. We asked our waiter for another creamer. We both decided to order their eggs benedict (I ordered the Florentine and my boyfriend ordered the crab).The Florentine was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were sloppy and the asparagus was small cut up piece. I almost sent it back because I thought the asparagus was missing. I am a big fan of eggs florentine and I was surprised to not see fresh asparagus. The asparagus looked like cut up pieces of artichoke hearts. Our English muffins were overly buttered and took away from the meal. My boyfriend didn't finish his crab benedict. It was salty and the overly buttered muffin didn't help. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing here today. The coffee was the best thing about our meal."

We called the first time to see if we can phone in an order and the lady said yes. The second time we called to actually give them an order another lady said we would have to come in and order at the bar. Then the third time I asked to be transferred to the bar and finally we were able to make our order. \n\nSo side note: If you call and want to place an order to go, just ask to be transferred to the bar.  \n\nWhen we got there our order was already waiting for us. Unfortunately it wasn't correct. I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle but all I got was a plain waffle. I let the bartender, Robert, know and he was on it. He was shocked and embarrassed that the order wasn't correct. His actual words were, \"This ain't Denny's!\" This guy was awesome! He offered us free mimosas while we waited. Who are we to decline free drinks?!\n\nThe bananas and sauce came out before we were halfway done with our mimosas. So we downed those things and were on our way. \n\nI think my waffle would have been quite delicious if it was fresh out of the kitchen. A bad part on me to order something like that to go. I did like how the waffle itself was fluffy too bad the crisp outside wasn't there anymore. However I did love the foster sauce! The brown sugar, butter, vanilla and cinnamon were well balanced. Very subtle sweetness that went well with the bananas.\n\nMy sister ordered the eggs benedict and while it wasn't the best we had it was still pretty darned tasty. The eggs were cooked perfectly the hollandaise sauce was a little watery to me but still flavorful.\n\nFood was pretty good but Robert's friendliness and attempt to please us stood out the most for me. People were eating at the bar too so if you don't want to wait for a table the bar is great. Especially if Robert's the bartender."

We were seated in the the dining area just before the cafe. It was a lovely spot because the sunlight was streaming in and it looked like a beautiful, peaceful atmosphere to have lunch in.\n\nOur waiter greeted us and we ordered right away; my bf ordered the Steak Frites and I ordered the Salmon dish. The wait was a bit long but nonetheless we were expecting the best from previous reviews. The dishes arrived and my bf received a beautiful juicy steak (order it medium) with a side of crispy potato \"fries\". Then the waiter grabs a dish of heaping mussels!!!! I thought to myself, \"Am I really going to have to eat this?\" since I'm not usually a person to complain at restaurants and actually considered just eating it. I kindly told the server, not our waiter, that I had ordered the Salmon. He said he would check with the waiter. The waiter came over and apologized claiming the buttons are right next to each other and had accidentally pressed the wrong button. Eek! Expensive mistake.\n\nI did wait for my salmon to be cooked and it did feel like it took a long time. I tried my bf's steak and I melted... trying to save my appetite I only had a few more bites but I was hooked. My salmon arrived and it was delicious! It had green peas, snow peas, in a \"green\" sauce. I'm not really sure how to describe it. It was light, refreshing, and the salmon was flakey. After we finished our meals, our waiter came back and offered to order us a dessert on the house. My bf and I shared the creme brulee which we were originally wanting to order but decided not to. Not it was free! It was a little over done as the crust layer was hard like candy, not slightly crusted, but I was just so happy that they acknowledged the mistake and comped us. Everything was wonderful and I will go back.\n\nP.S. When I came back home to LA, I gushed to a friend that I went to this place for lunch and she claimed that her mother always eats there when in Vegas because the food is so good. Score!"

For cocktails the waitress recommended a French Martini, sounded good, tasted fantastic, but failed to check on cost and it was $12.95 for one drink!  OK it was super fantastic, (gee I need to make more money).. Shared a baked cheese appetizer, table loved it, I had the scallops with a pureed mushroom sauce, best scallops I had ever eaten. Think they were $23.. Lovely.. would not hesitate to return ..this is a steak house, but no one tried a steak, one guy dieting had soup, another had the fish and chips which was a flat fillet rather than the breaded chunky pieces you usually see.  Everything was excellent, bill was $180 for 3, which included 3 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine and a shared dessert."

  "text" : "Eating in Las Vegas isn't cheap and any place that serves an entree in the realm of $25 can be considered a bargain. We decided to come here for a pre-show dinner. We hadn't eaten anything French recently and being from a backwoods town in the South where French isn't something you see very often, we were ready to try this place. We got reservations and had to only wait about 10 minutes for our table. We got an authentic French waiter but the poor thing was confused for most of the night. I am sure our Southern accents scared the hell out of him. He couldn't remember the specials but that was ok since he seemed like a pretty nice guy.\n\nWe were starving since we had skipped lunch that day. I ordered the Onion Soup which was very good. They give you a fairly large portion which could be easily split between two people or eaten as a meal in itself with a salad. Our table also ordered the Baked Cheese as appetizer which was delicious. I ended up getting the Steak Bearnaise with hand-cut fries. Not a big fan of the fries. They were cooked properly but I like my potatoes cut thicker. The steak was cooked perfectly and tender. The Bearnaise sauce was very good and probably the highlight of the entree. We passed on dessert. \n\nService was good but not exceptional. The food was good but nothing was spectacular enough to warrant a 5 star consideration. This place is probably more of a 3.5 stars but I will round up due to the appetizer and nice atmosphere. I will be moving to the DC area soon so I may have to hit up the one in Bethesda. For the price you can't beat it though."

It is in the Paris right on the street across from the Bellagio fountains so it is popular, but at some point restaurants need to just say NO. The place was brimming with people. We were there 10 minutes before our reservation and we still had to wait at the bar for about 1/2 an hour. We were seated in a kind of crappy spot...between the bar and the kitchen.

The only thing on this appetizer that wasn't amazing was the seaweed salad.  Worth the $24.95 a person price tag.  Also had the Steak Roquefort served with these crispy potatoes.  Very flavorful, but you better love Roquefort cheese or this dish is not for you.  \n\nHonestly, the food is beside the point at Mon Ami Gabi.

I didnt taste the excargot, because under no circumstance, will i eat it, i just dont like the taste and consistency.  The french onion soup, was the second best i've ever had, a place near me that is now closed, had the best ive ever had, and this easily took second.  It came out and was also a great portion, for me, a bigger guy with a big appetite.  It was fantastic.  My friend said the escargot was good.\n\nMain course - I ordered the filet mignon, with merlot butter, and my friend ordered the filet au poivre with creme fraiche, both medium rare.  Both of these steaks were cooked perfectly.  They also tasted delicious.  There was a difference in the sauce, but the steaks were exactly the same, which is good.  We had gone to craftsteak the night before, but the two places are oddly very different from each other.  \n\noverall - easily worth going to, easily order the french onion soup."

They dont care, not even a congratulatory message. Got the table on the patio we requested, the view was awesome. Bellagio is right across from the restaurant so we can even see the fountain while eating. The restaurant got really busy right around 7:45-8pm on a Saturday night. \n\nWe ordered some frites, soup of the day, sea scallops, pork chop, steelhead (their special that night).  However, there was something wrong with the server. He was not all quite there, twitching, blinking, stuttering, bumping into the backs of our chairs, etc. We received our frites and entrees not long after we placed the order; however, the soup never showed up. We asked the server about it and he was so confused. So we just cancelled the soup as we didn't want to wait.  \n\nFood was okay, nothing special. The frites and scallops were so salty even though they were cooked pretty well. The frites also looked and tasted like the scraps left at the bottom of the pan, brown, over fried crumbs.  The excessive amount of salt totally ruined the dishes. Steelhead was tasty, but we realized that it's 28 bucks when we got the check. It's pretty costly compared to most of the entrees on the menu (average $19-$24). \n\nDefinitely not worth going back again for the food and service. For the view? Maybe. How disappointing!"

Boy was I wrong... \nCame here with the parents and sat down a little bit after our reservation time, no big deal. The server Martan(?) was alright as he recommended a good wine for the table. Anyways, the hot baguette and pickled carrots were an alright starter. Then came the appetizer; the baked cheese (don't ask why the father thought it would be good). The baked cheese tasted more like a bowl of spaghetti o's sauce accompanied by a piece of pesto covered bread, ick. \n     Then came the entrees; I ordered the steak bordelaise which came with scrapped french fries which were probably the best part of my experience at mon ami gabi. The first couple bites of my steak were alright, as i ordered it medium, expecting it to be as so throughout, boy was I wrong (again). 2 bites through, I started noticing it was nearly impossible to cut through the steak, much less chew it, without feeling like it was about to fly away off the plate at 100 miles per hour. What I was left with was a mangled piece of tendon, and 2 half chewed rubbery pieces of meat that I couldnt muster up the courage to swallow. Bottom line, this place charges above average prices for below average food, but if you like good bread and french fries, come here I guess. You wont see me here again... for 60 bucks a head I'll wait to head to L'entrecote when I'm in London next."

Hey - we could still see some street performers and a few walks of shame. Fine by me.\n\nThe service was most excellent and efficient to boot. I went with the lemon pancakes - a giant, but very thin, lemony crepe like pancake with strawberries and a hefty side of fresh whipped cream. Hell. Yeah. The pancake was delicious yet light and the strawberries were uber fresh. I also nabbed a few bites of hubs' quiche lorraine - also a delightful, rich and tasty choice. The one food item I wasn't crazy about was the chicken sausage. Normally I'd down that in 30 seconds flat, but these particular links had an odd spice combo to them...paprika? I don't know, but I didn't dig it. \n\nPrice wise, Mon Ami Gabi is quite fair - especially for the high quality and portions. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely head back here for breakfast!"

Two girls taking the patio reservations extremely rude and unaccomodating when my wife was seated first while I was paying the bar tab; could not be bothered to tell me where they had seated her and I should just go find her. Service started badly with bread and amouse bouche just plunked down on the table with not explanation. Fortunately management came to the rescue with an apology and champagne. Service from there was great and so was the food. As a local there are many places to dine and the initial experience sets the stage."

It's served with a yummy salad of carrots and pads of melty butter.\n\nAny dish you order will be delish, and the alcoholic beverages you choose will knock your socks off.  I've only had one bad experience there - my husband got food poisoning from a raw steak (he asked for it \"still mooing\").  I warned him it looked too raw, but he ate it anyways.  So, the restaurant can't lose points ;-)\n\nThe frites are excellent, green beans tasty, and any steak on the menu is fabulous.  I haven't tried a dessert there yet, but plan to soon.  Going back for our first wedding anniversary, the perfect place for a romantic dinner... Also, if it's a warm evening, ask for a table outside - you'll get a fabulous view of the Bellagio water show!"

It was a little hectic because we needed to be someplace in an hour and we were told our table wouldn't be ready for another 15 minutes. We asked if we could put in our food orders while we waited for our table and the hostess and manager were very accommodating. \n\nI wanted to eat light, so I ordered the Scallops Gratinee and the French Onion soup. The scallops were absolutely scrumptious: three little shell- shaped tins filled with roasted garlic and creamed spinach, topped with a sea scallop that melted in my mouth. I gobbled this up so quickly. Then I moved on to the French Onion soup, which was warm and full of ooey-gooey cheese that made my tummy and my tastebuds smile.\n\nI REALLY wanted to sit in the patio to watch the fountains, but there was a two hour wait. Apparently it's first come, first serve for those tables and you can't reserve them. Oh well, that would have made my birthday perfect, but at least they got us in and out so we could get to Marquee on time! \n\nCan't wait to go back with the hubby!"

They offer a wide selection of wines by the glass and while the restaurant is busy and noisy (much like the rest of Las Vegas Blvd) it is easy to get swept away into a great meal. \n\nKeep in mind that even if you make a reservation and ask to be seated on the balcony, they will not always honour it."

It was a great reminder of my recent trip to Paris.  Some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  \nAs a party of five, we started off with a carafe of \"Frangria,\" which was fantastic!  Then had three different appetizers to share:  Warm Brie Cheese, Warm Duck Confit Salad, and the Mussels Mariniere. Two Onion Soups au Gratin.  Then for our individual entrees we ordered:  Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad, Steak Classique, Bone-in Ribeye, Sea Scallops, \"Poisson du Jour\" = Sea Bass w/ Roasted Corn Couscous.

Bananas Foster Crepe.  \nIn summary, here's what I would definitely get again and what items I would pass up.  \nFive Stars:  Frangria, Mussels Mariniere (so memorable!), Warm Brie Cheese--was finished off, but I personally didn't have any because I'm not a cheese person, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad (yummy poached egg!), Bone-in Ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), Sea Scallops, Bananas Fosters Crepe\nFaaaaahget about it:  Warm Duck Confit Salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in Paris--lacked salt/flavor), Onion Soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), Steak Classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)"

I made the reservation a week in advance.  \n\nWhen I got there, I had to change it because a girl dropped out. If you use Yelp to get phone numbers, this one is incorrect.  It takes you to Effiel Tower Restaurant.  I did eventually get through and told her I needed to \"change tomorrow's reservation.\" (The reason I changed it for one person is because if your entire party isn't seated, you can't be considered for deck seating.) She told me she couldn't find me anywhere and I was put on hold for a long time, several times.  Finally she said \"I found your reservation under tomorrow.  There must have been an error.\" Me: \"Nope. I wanted it for tomorrow.\" Gah.  So that was figured out.\n\nThen the day of, the girls are running late and ask me to push it back.  I tell the hostess, \"can you push the reservation for Ninette for 11 back 30 minutes?\" She said, \"ok Clark (or something equally ridiculous) for 5!\" What now? Eh, maybe it was loud.\n\nWe did make it there and were seated inside (outside was a 2 hour wait).  My friend and I ordered the escargot for appetizer to share and the seafood platter for our entree.  The seafood platter came with 4 oysters, shrimp cocktail, tuna cervice, seaweed salad, several sauces and an entire lobster.  I also just checked and there were supposed to be crackers. Huh. Never saw that. Either way, it looked pretty impressive, not going to lie.  The escargot were good.  They came in a pesto-ish sauce.  The seafood platter was all good except for the main event: the lobster.  The lobster was chewy and overcooked.  We thought we would need steak knives.  I don't know what kind of lobster it was called but it had the spongy legs/claws that I didn't really like either.\n\nI still think this place is pretty reasonably priced and a good balance between casual and fancy for Vegas.  The bad lobster and confusion put me off a bit more than the first time, but for mostly-good food and prices, I'll keep my 3.5 stars under 4."

  "text" : "BOTTOM LINE: There are enough good things about Mon Ami Gabi to deserve a four star review based on our dinner there last week. With so many restaurants in Las Vegas on the Strip, this is not one we'd necessarily seek out again unless it was a matter of convenience and timing that led us there.  But the outdoor patio seating provides a great opportunity for people watching and seeing the Bellagio fountain both, the food is good and the prices reasonable by Las Vegas standards.  So we're glad we went and can easily recommend it.\n\nSEATING: We were a group of ten and we wanted an outdoor table so some of the folks involved  who had not been to Las Vegas before could watch the Bellagio fountains, right across the street, as they had dinner. \n\nReservations are not taken for outdoor seating, and it was impressive that they could cobble together a table for ten with only about a 30 minute wait at 6:30. But what we learned from this is that Mon Ami Gabi's outdoor patio seating is probably best for couples or groups up to six just for the logistics of putting tables together. \n\nSERVICE: The restaurant was hopping inside and out and yet service was efficient for taking the orders and getting the food to the right diners and served at the right temperature. Not particularly friendly, but efficient worked in this case. \n\nFOOD: For a Las Vegas restaurant the range of choices, all with a French bistro bent, was impressive and the prices seemed more reasonable than other comparable places on the Strip. \n\nAs example, a duck confit small plate that included a good dried cherry garnish was only about $11 and plenty for an entree for a light eater. Same with the crab cake served with a small slaw type salad for about $15. Same for the Caesar salad that was about $10. Steaks (served with pommes frites) for roughly $25.00 each. Scallop entree was about $30. And so on. Meals included some really good, crusty baguette set in the middle of the table in paper bags at the start. \n\nVALUE:  Total bill for ten, excluding cocktails but including a couple of beers, a couple of coffees and a soft drink,  was about $230.  A bargain by Strip standards. \n\nLIBATIONS: While we waited on our table, some of us adjourned to the (tiny) indoor bar for a cocktail. My hubby said his Maker's mint julep was very good and my Sidecar was one of the best I've had. Cousins in law had good things to say about their rum and cokes and whiskey and sodas. Cousin in law who picked up the tab said they were spendy. As I recall, five cocktails topped $60. \n\nAMBIANCE: The outdoor patio can be fun, for the reasons named in the start of this review. The indoor portion of the restaurant is actually quite large and seating in some of it offers a white tablecloth, cozy bistro ambiance. But, the indoor seating adjacent to the outdoor bar is NOT the best in the place...not the charm of inside and not the view perspective of outside and with a lot of traffic through it from wait staff and diners. So we'd recommend avoiding this section of the restaurant.\n\nRESERVATION NOTE:  If you make a reservation (indoor seating only) you will need to provide a credit card.  Two hour in advance cancellation is required or your credit card will be charged $50 per head of the reservation. (Example, for a reservation for six people the default charge is $300.)  This isn't the only restaurant in Las Vegas to employ a similar tactic (Mesa as example does something similar).  But may be helpful to know this in advance."

Prices were comparable to a $$ restaurant in LA, but the quality and freshness of the meal was superb.

I couldn't believe that in such a touristy spot I would stumble upon a restaurant devoted so earnestly to quality cuisine.\n\nOur appetizers consisted of vegetable crudites and hand-cut potato chips.  Simple yet delicious, the waffle-cut chips were thin and crispy.\n\nI tasted the bacon brie cheeseburger, the tuna nicoise and the vichyssoise, and I'd recommend all of them.  The tuna tartine was topped with some of the best seared ahi I've eaten, seasoned with something heavenly.  The brie burger was so decadent, so juicy and flavorful, that I completely forgot that I was eating in the bulls eye of the tourist capital of the country.  Even without the brie the burger was cooked perfectly and made of some of the best ground beef I've tasted.  The vichyssoise was standard, but it tasted fantastic on a hot June afternoon.\n\nThe rest of the menu looks heavenly.  I'm sure the next time I'm in Sin City I'll make my way there.  Bon appetit!"

We loved it!! \n\nSide note: A lot of people recommended sitting outside (to see the fountains) but honestly we realized while it would have been great for bellagio fountain and people watching it is much more of a dining experience inside. Stand outside, watch the show before you go in. Then once inside let yourself be whisked away into a French feast fantasy. \n\nIt will be si magnifique!"

The service was utter crap, as our waitress was textbook awkward, but I'm not sure that I really cared all that much, come to think of it.\n\nTo set this review up: One of the things I dreaded most about this last trip to Vegas, was the amount of money I would be pouring on food, given my girlfriend is a very demanding foodie, and this was her birthday weekend, so she had very high expectations (and damnit, she is demanding!). However, I was at ease while looking through Mon Ami Gabi's menu online.. and she loves French food, so I thought this place would be a good fit for the both of us.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\nMe: Prime Steak Sandwich $14\nHer: Seafood Crepe $14 and Sangria $5\n\nYou also get a complimentary baguette (that's fancy for skinny French bread) w/ butter.\n\nThe prime steak sandwich was very good, and I believe my girlfriend enjoyed her seafood crepe and sangria. Yes, she always orders a sangria, even with lunch. But guess what, I didn't mind because the sangria here only cost $5! So drink here instead of above at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, where the drinks are $20 (I know, because I had to pay for them later that night!).\n\nI'm surprising myself by giving Mon Ami Gabi 4 stars, for a good meal, comfortable patio seating, and reasonable pricing.

  "text" : "Wish I could say, it was packed because of the quality of the food.\n\nRestaurant is right on the strip, in front of Paris, and facing the bellagio fountains. It's all about location, location, location! \n\nOur party of four came on a saturday night for dinner. Of course it was a full house. We were told it would be an hour wait for inside & an hour and a half for outside. Since it was getting late we opted for whatever was fastest. Thankfully we only waited roughly 45 mins & we were even seated outside :) YAY lucky us!\n\nTables and seating arrangements were really narrow. Complimentary bread was pretty yummy - your typical french bread. Except they gave butter and this interesting shredded carrot spread. Oddly enough, it was actually quite good with the bread. LOL!\n\nI ordered the steak classique with maitre d hotel butter. ($23.95), which is a large thin cut of steak with an herb butter sauce. It was good but nothing outstanding. The meat was a large piece, but thin so when asked for medium, it was more medium well to well done. The fries that accompanied it were overfried & overly crispy.  \n\nThe rest of my party wasn't too impressed as well. They got the filet mignon, steak bordelaise, and scallops. Our table rated the scallops as the best thing that night.\n\nAmbiance was nice, romantic, but over crowded so it kinda killed the romance. Service was just okay. Kinda had to ask for refills on bread & soft drinks. They were good about refilling water though. Best thing about the place is sitting outside on the patio watching the bellagio show while eating. Would I go back? Surprising to say but probably not. I could have ate better quality & more at a buffet for the price."

If you want a more intimate experience, go to Joel Rubichon or Guy Savoy where you'll get better quality food."

  "text" : "My meal at Mon Ami Gabi can be summed up in one word : TENDER.\n\nTender is a strange word on its own, but when combined with other words like filet and mignon it is perfection.\n\nA group of 6 of us arrived to the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant on a Friday night (with a reservation, which I highly recommend), and waited about 15 minutes to get a table.  They have a huge outdoor seating area, but we requested to sit indoors because it was in the triple digits outside.  We were sat in the area adjacent to the patio, which ironically was really chilly and a number of people around us felt the same way.  Beware the breezy area betwixt the outside HEAT and the a/c CHILL from inside.\n\nAnyhow, the food was AMAZING.  HIghlights were the fromage appetizer with a blend of yummy cheeses, and the amazement that was the Filet Mignon with Merlot butter sauce.  \n\nIf you get the server known as 'Georgie,' you'll be in for a treat.  She was absolutely lovely, and took the time to explain many things to us, from drinks to entrees.  She was awesome.\n\nOverall, an awesome experience.. and I'll say it again.. the Filet Mignon was perfect, juicy and tender.  And I do love me tender.."

The croissants and raspberry jam are perfect together. They have some of the best coffee I've ever tasted. EVERYTHING for breakfast is pretty much great. The waitstaff are friendly. For dinner: the steaks are well worth the money. I wouldn't pay $35-45/per person every night for dinner, but it is worth going at least once for dinner. Love this place. Make sure you make reservations, especially for dinner."

Now you're lucky to get seated within an hour if you come without a reservation.\n\nThe food is marvelous and you get good value for your money. We came here before we had kids and after and it's accommodating for both types of parties. The kid's menu has generous portions with one order feeding two small kids. The french onion soup is delish, the escargot is fresh, the steaks are always tasty and tender and the bananas foster crepe for dessert is to-die-for! Nice ambiance and most of the time the waiters are really nice.\n\nQuick tip: grab a seat on the patio and enjoy the free Bellagio show while you dine. Great distraction for little kids!"

  "text" : "I am very conflicted about this place...\n\nThe food was excellent.  Our personal server was polite and helpful.  \n\nBut the host service was dreadful.  And because of that, I'm giving this place only 3 stars where it normally would earn 4 easy, maybe 5 on a good day.  \n\nNow let me explain...\n\nWe had made reservation for our friend's birthday dinner.  To me, when you make a reservation (especially at a fine dining restaurant like Mon Ami) there are certain expectations that come along with that.  First and foremost, you expect to be seated in a reasonable amount of time.  We sat down at 9:00 for an 8:30 reservation!  Second, you expect the whole process to be relatively hassle-free...you give them your name and they seat at the table that is RESERVED for you.  But instead they handed up a pager and told us to wait.  When the pager went off they told us they could seat us outside (even though we requested indoor seating for the reservation) shortly or indoors in 5 minutes.  Now for most restaurants, I would be a lot more understanding of the hardworking host staff.  But for a place like this, part of the price of the meal goes towards the service offered by the establishment.  I felt we did not get that value on the night we dined.   \n\nAll venting and ranting aside, the ambiance, food, and waiter service were excellent.  I would recommend the warm brie cheese and the sea scallops for hors d'oeuvres.  The bone-in ribeye is excellent, and strongly consider their specials.  Our group tried their roasted orange duck and sea bass, both very good.  \n\nIn closing, chances are, that if you go on any random night, you will have a perfectly pleasant dining experience, but don't be shocked if you find yourself frustrated waiting for your reservation."

I like to wear pretty pretty dress, throw on some pearls and maybe throw on a beret and say \"Bon Appetit!\"  Then I like to take a stroll down to Paris and eat brunch by the Eiffel Tower. What a life I live...\n\nOh wait...did I forget to mention that stroll is to the Paris Las Vegas? Or that I eat my beautiful brunch at the DIVINE Mon Ami Gabi French Bistro that happens to be by the replica of the Eiffel Tower? Oh..I didn't?\n\nNot to fret! This truly is the next best thing when it comes to french cuisine and dining in Las Vegas.\n\nMon Ami Gabi is truly one of my favorite places to eat in the city let alone on the Strip. They truly capture the classic french bistro from the decor of the restaurant to the meal that sits in front of you.  \n\nYou can sit on the terrace as well as inside their beautiful what seems to look like an beautiful atrium. Either way you have a magnificent view of the Bellagio Fountains which play every 15-30 min. Meal and show! \n\nThe food is absolutely delicious. My favorite breakfast item are the Blueberry Waffle and the Eggs Benedict The Blueberry Waffle is to crispy with a light airy inside which truly compliments the homemade blueberry glaze and fresh whipped cream. It is light as air ad doesn't give you the feeling of eating something heavy.  When it comes to the Eggs Benedict it revolves around one word : HOLLINDAISE. Hollindaise sauce is an emulsion of egg yolk and butter. It is a creamy delicious touch on top your poached eggs place on a slice of  french baguette. \n\nIf you like French Onion you must try theirs! It is truly the best I have had in Vegas. The guryere cheese baked on top of the soup is amazing. I could possibly eat that alone. \n\nNow time for tips:\n\n1. If you plan on going on the weekend for any meal, I HIGHLY suggest you make a reservation.  They are very busy and the wait can be up to an hour.\n\n2. Try going during the week it is not as busy. \n\n3. If it is blazing hot outside, do not sit on the terrace. You will fry. Plus the umbrellas don't move they are bolted into the ground. So shade is not always an option\n\nPersonal Request:  Please say bon appetit...just for moi. I will love you forever. Pinky Promise. \n\nBON APPETIT MON ANGE!\n                           (my angel)"

At Mon Ami, for appetizers, entrees, and drinks you can have a meal that will fill you up and it will taste delicious-all for the price of a buffet on the strip.  \n\nFor appetizers, we got the patte with baguettes.  I forgot the name, but it was the creamier, easier to spread patte.  It tasted great.  The bread is also straight from the oven (I don't know if it's entirely fresh, but it's good nonetheless).  It hit the spot right away.  For the entree, I ordered the steak frites with a mushroom sauce and my fiancee ordered the seared scallops.  The steak frites was excellent (the frites were a little to salty for my taste).  The seared scallops were cooked beautifully.  The service was great as well.  I will definitely come back whenever I make another Vegas trip."

  "text" : "We came here for Sunday brunch on the first day of our Vegas trip.  We arrived around 11am after checking into our hotel.  We were starving and craving a nice breakfast.  However, we were sad to learn that unlike other restaurants we were used too, they weren't serving their usual breakfast menu at that time.  They had maybe 5 items on their brunch menu and the rest was off their lunch menu.  I specifically asked the waiter if any other breakfast items were available, but he was unaccomodating.  It was especially dissapointing because the table right next to us were able to order breakfast and they received their food less than 10 minutes before us. As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the waffle with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  It was $15 for ONE waffle that could have came out of a box.  The whip cream that everyone raves about was just meh!  But I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of whip cream in general (waste of calories for something that doesn't even taste that good).  I ordered the quiche which was ok but very rich.  You can definitely taste all the butter and cream they put in it.  It was more of a custard consistency than I'm used to though.  As for the service, our waiter basically sucked and seemed to have airs about him.  He spent most of the time talking in the corner with his friends.  My coffee was never refilled and it took us forever to get our check.  Then it took at least another 10-15 minutes for him to pick it up so he can run our credit card.  We don't usually ask much of our waiters and usually tip very well.  But this was rediculous!  He failed to realize that every minute of his inattentiveness was decreasing his tip.  But maybe the service is better on the outside patio.  We were just too hungry to wait for a table there.  It was immediate seating inside.  Still, a huge dissapointment all around.  Definitely not worth it when there are so many other places to eat on the strip."

Two got steaks with different sauces--one bordelaise and mine the roquefort.  The other main courses were the crab cake and the herb grilled chicken breast.  Two shared a side of macaroni and cheese and two shared the garlic spinach.\n\nThe steaks for both of us were done perfectly just as we ordered.  The pommes frites were excellent.  The spinach and mac and cheese were both great!  We had an extremely pleasant dinner.  It was a fine evening with my wife and two good friends from the east.\n\nOf course the view of the Bellagio fountains across the street was very good.  This time I didn't notice Mon Ami silence their music so you could hear the fountain music.  Also, the restaurant was quite noisy.  Part of that was street noise.  I deduct a half point for that and although our server was basically good, a half point for forgetting to bring the iced teas until reminded 5 minutes later and for a general attitude that just seemed to rub me the wrong way.\n\nWhat better way to spend two hours on a summer evening than dining with 2 good friends, enjoying good conversation and have a very good meal!

It wasn't horrible or anything, but I have made this type of soup before and I felt like mine was better! Oh well. \n\nThird thing we shared was the shrimp cocktail--with HUGE shrimp! Shrimp was good, so was the tartar sauce. Can't really mess it up too much..\n\nWe tried the mojito as well (I was immediately drawn to it because it had St. Germain and Champagne in it..it was very good!) Their version of Sangria was delicious also.\n\nI guess this might not be the greatest review since we didn't really eat substantial food there lol, but I guess just try the salad, I swear it's amazing!"

Hostesses did not acknowledge my party of two. We decided to stop at the bar before being seated and she was a charm. Great conversation as well as delicious drinks. I recommend ordering the grape specialty cocktail! So we're seated and we get greeted by a wonderful Albanian server. She makes the experience better, we order, watch the beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountain Show, and end our visit. Overall as I said it was okay. I wouldn't come here again nor recommend this restaurant to anyone."

We were seated right by the entrance of the patio, so we still got a great view of the strip without suffering from the infamous Vegas heat. The restaurant has a great ambiance and really makes you feel like you're in Paris! Our waitress was very attentive, friendly, and helpful, too, which I always, ALWAYS appreciate.\n\nI read some reviews mentioning the waffles were supposed to be good, so I ended up ordering the blueberry waffles. You yelpers definitely have good taste because holy crap those waffles were GOOOOOOD! They were fresh, tasted homemade (even better because I can't make waffles like they do) with nice crispy edges and a crunchy/soft middle. I was super impressed with the blueberries they used because each one was nice and sweet, not a sour one in the bunch they poured over my waffles! The whipped cream tasted homemade, too, which really made the waffles that much more amazing, so good. Seriously. I could've eaten the whipped cream with a spoon. And lastly, the warm, blueberry syrup was TDF - perfect amount of sweetness!\n\nI can't wait to come back and try their Filet Mignon w/ Merlot Butter Sauce!"

The first time we went, I was feeling guilty the entire day being so glutinous in Vegas that I ordered the Ahi tuna salad. It was good, but I immediately regretted my decision after I tried my husband's steak and frites.  The next day, we came back and we both ordered the steak and frittes. The steak was tender and the caramelized onion sauce complimented it really well. I usually order my steak medium, but since the steak was really thin, I had to order it medium rare to prevent them from overcooking it. The frites were really good, too! It's even better after it's been soaked in the au jus. \n\nIt's also reasonably priced for being on the strip! We were able to sit outside and do some people watching while eating our delicious food.  - I'm drooling just thinking about their steak and frites... YUM!"

I've never been disappointed with anyone.. starting with the hostess, to the waiter/waitresses. Everyone is super friendly and very attentive! \n\nYou can't make a reservation to sit in the patio, but this last time around, we came here at 6:30pm (for party of 2) with a normal reservation. We just ended up waiting 15 minutes to sit at the patio (they do not take reservations for the patio) so that we can watch the Bellagio fountain show! Sitting in the patio can be quite romantic and cute! :) \n\nI've gotten the steak here a bunch of times which is always good. This last time around, had the seafood platter for two (lobster, shrimp, oysters, tuna tartar).. especially on a hot day, I'd highly recommend it! The tuna tartar was VERY good. \n\nThe only thing I did not like food-wise from my experience so far.. was their chilled soup of the day. I forget exactly what it's called, but something with almonds and grapes? NOT good. \n\nFor the appetizer - I've also had the chilled gazpacho with avocado.. THAT was delicious! (and good during the summer time)\n\nOverall - I'd highly recommend! Great food, great service.. and won't burn a hole in your wallet ;)"

The dinner I don't remember much of due to the great bottle of wine my friend and I shared, but I do remember we were sitting on the outside patio and it does feel a little bit crammed in there. The meal made up for it- I know I had some kinda steak with bearnaise sauce that was to-die-for. During my most recent Vegas trip I had lunch: a croque madame (fried egg on top of an open faced hot ham and gruyere cheese sandwich) and French onion soup. The croque madame was perfect and in a much larger portion than I expected. It comes with a side of pomme frites. The French onion soup was nothing special but I'm a sucker for anything with gruyere cheese so I still enjoyed it even though the soup inside was a bit cold. They also include a fresh baguette with your meal. So all of that plus a glass of their sangria called \"Frangria\" and I was set for the rest of the day. Je t'aime Mon Ami Gabi!"

Yes, you can pay $100 for a nice dry-aged rib eye at a high-end steakhouse, but you'll be just as satisfied paying $25 for this work of art.  \n\nGood prices, good service, consistently great food...Mon Ami is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas."

I had some cheese to start and a glass of wine with their magnificent bread. My dining companion had the French onion soup, which she loved.\n\nWe both had the steak frites, me with the red wine sauce and she had the bleu cheese sauce. Hers was better than mine and I'm not even a bleu fan! Huge portions for a really good price. Lots of frites, very yummy. Would return.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant was very cute, make a reservation, though, because it gets packed. \nYou cannot reserve an outside table, those are on first-come-first-served basis and are the hot property in Vegas at night because you can water the Bellagio water fountain show, though I'd imagine every 15 minutes during your meal that it would be annoying..."

I came here once before with a group of friends and thought that the food was just okay here but this time around I thought the food was great! I made a reservation through open table thank goodness because Saturday night they were actually turning away walk-in! I mention it was my bf and dad's birthday so that's probably why they sat us at a table with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\n I had the filet mignon and the bf had the rib eye omg it was so tender and flavorful... probably because of the TONS of butter they used. My dad had the trout and my mom had the scallops, both were cooked perfectly! \n\nI really wanted to give this place 5 starts but service was sort of slow... probably because the waiter knew he was going to get his 20% gratuity because they automatically add gratuity for parties of 5 or more.  I would rather give the busboy the  gratuity since he was checking up on us more than our actual waiter."

I was fine since we were seated underneath a table with a canopy. \n\nI ordered a glass of Rose and it accompanied my BLT tartine, a French style open faced sandwich perfectly. The bread was perfectly toasted and buttered.  The lettuce, tomatoes and avocado was so fresh and crisp and such a nice light meal in the Vegas heat. \n\nBut i must share with you that although my meal was light and perfect for a lunch the bf ordered their mussel in cream sauce and OMG i almost had foodgasm. The flavor of the cream sauce was so rich but it did not overpower the taste of the mussel, and the mussel was sweet and tender, not rubbery or stiff.  \n\nI am still debating if that was onion in the cream sauce or sauerkraut because the texture and taste was sour but crisp and with onion once its cooked down it does not hold a crisp texture plus it tends to taste sweet not tart.  \n\nAnywho i cannot wait to visit this eatery again and i shall hunt down a French recipe for mussel in cream sauce."

  "text" : "On our last night in Vegas I took my wife here for a late dinner. This location had been recommended by a local for the romantic atmosphere. We sat on the patio which sits facing the Bellagio. We didn't eat until almost 8PM, the fountains where putting on their show every 15 minutes giving it a little extra to the atmosphere.\n\n The Service was remarkable. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly, answering my questions. He asked if we wanted a bottle of wine. At first I said no, but changed my mind as it was our last night in Vegas and I wanted to have a special dinner with my wife. Of course I know nothing about wine. My palette is mainly attuned for beer and spirits. The waiter asked some questions then made a recommendation. His recommendation was spot on. I really wish I could remember the name of the wine as we both loved it. \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Country Pate. We both enjoyed it. It had a rich flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. It was a great way to start the meal. \n\nThe main course my wife wanted the Seafood Platter for two: Lobster, shrimp, oysters, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. The shrimp were huge. The lobster was delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife didn't like the oysters, but I enjoyed them. The tuna tartar had a great flavor and was combined with avocado that helped balance out the tuna. Neither one of us liked the seaweed salad, but I think that's a personal taste issue. The best part of the meal was the sauce they provided for the lobster, it was like a horseradish mustard. The tasted fantastic! Definitely worth a try. \n\nWe contemplated ordering dessert, but we were both full. \n\nIf you go, and the weather is right, I would recommend sitting on the Patio. The combination of the fountains, the décor and being able to watch people walking up and down the strip made for a fun evening. \n\nOverall the entire experience was amazing. I would definitely go back if I ever go to Vegas again."

This is one and the other is a green building that I wont mention next to MGM Grand.\n\nMon Ami Gabi really shines in the steaks that are served with something. I can't recall exactly what it was but I believe it was the blue cheese. The wine list here is pretty good and most of the reds compliment the steaks very well. We had a large party of 10 for a bachelor pad and the seated us quickly (without reservations) and the service was spot on.\n\nThe view is nice and romantic for couples. Inside is more where the family action is at. I always look to this as one of my defaults if I do know want to search for food. How can you go wrong with the potatoe frites and a great fillet and a red wine?"

The first night, before heading out for the night, we got dressed up and decided to have a fancy dinner. Their fresh, warm baguettes are AMAZING. We both had the French Onion soup and shared a bottle of their house Chardonnay. The soup was soooooo delicious. Burnt cheese is always delicious. Brothy and full of flavor, I don't think I've ever had a better French onion soup. Their wine was yummy, but we are not wine connoisseurs, so we could really have cared less- just wanted to catch a buzz. Our waitress wasn't the greatest. A little slow and seems disinterested in our table.\n\n The second time, we grabbed lunch. Baguette was a little hard, but still tasty. My friend got the soup again and I swear it tasted EVEN better than the night before. I had the Shrimp Cocktail and it was delish. Jumbo shrimp were served on ice with a really yummy cocktail sauce with fresh garlic on top. So good! Much better service this time around."

It was the best Quiche Lorraine I have EVER had!  Creamy, flavorful, and a crust to die for!  I've been around a few years so I know my quiche.  My husband had the Ham & Cheese Omelette - holy cow - another creamy winner!  The white toast is really their amazing rustic french bread - wow.. deelish!  We were seated within 5 minutes at 10:30am on a Sunday with a view of the Bellagio fountains to entertain us while we dined.  The menu says the OJ is \"fresh squeezed\" but it's really not squeezed from an orange just before you get it.  It's Tropicana-like \"fresh squeezed\" ... clearly a difference.  \n\nWe liked our breakfast so much that we went back two days later.  I had the Spinach & Green Vegetable omelette (fab!) and my husband had the Corned Beef Hash w poached eggs (VERY flavorful!).  I got the Hashed Browns that time and was pleasantly surprised to discover beautiful caramelized onions mixed in.  Oh so flavorful.\n\nCoffee - some of the best my husband's had.\nService - outstanding\nAmbiance - terrific\nStrip Location - on the strip, facing the Bellagio fountains at Paris.\nPrice - incredibly reasonable!  No different than what you'd pay at a decent breakfast chain (NOT Denny's, but more like a Mimi's Cafe).\n\nWe will be back!"

We had made reservations at this restaurant in advance to ensure a nice anniversary dinner before we had tickets for the Blue Man Group. We're young (25 at the time) and that can often make a fancy restaurant turn it's nose up and not offer much help. This was nothing like that!\nWe came in dressed for our night, and were sat quickly. The waiter was nice, offered up specials and was ready to serve. We picked a wine, food and everything was amazing. The steak, was so well cooked, you didn't need a knife. We were suggested bananas foster as a great dessert to share and enjoyed it together. The bill was high, but well worth it, and the waiter enjoyed a good tip from us. Really enjoyed it, and would go back in a heartbeat if we are in the city again."

  "text" : "My wife and I were in town with her sister and her sister's husband for the weekend and upon doing some Yelp research it seemed like this restaurant was the most reviewed restaurant with a 4+ star score and two dollar signs.  Definitely a must try.\n\nWe made reservations for 7:30pm on Friday night.  It was a good move because the place was packed and there was a long wait for walk-ins.  Make reservations!  There is a patio outside that is heavily air conditioned and provides a view to the Bellagio fountains (albeit with some trees in the way) and LV Blvd.  Even in the heat of Summer, the A/C makes sitting out there reasonable.  It's pretty crazy.\n\nThe inside is pretty large and has a dim, romantic vibe to it.  Classy but not stuffy.  It was bustling with activity and somewhat cozy with the tables.  We were seated a little late because the place was so packed and they were running behind.\n\nWhen we sat we got some wine and ordered.  Ultimately, we ordered the filet mignon done three ways (standard, au poivre, and with blue cheese) and a chicken dish.  My advice: stick to the steak.  I can't speak to the normal steak, but the filets were excellent.  Well prepared, super tender, excellent flavor, and reasonably filling at 8oz portions.  Very good for $32.  The chicken, on the other hand, was disappointing to my sister-in-law's husband.\n\nThe dishes come with either frites, which are basically thinly sliced french fries made crispy, or mashed potatoes.  The frites are good but not amazing.  The mashed potatoes are really good, though.  The mac 'n cheese is also pretty good.  Creme brulee was so so.\n\nSummary: Get reservations.  Get the filet mignon, or maybe the standard steak.  Don't bother with anything else.  Mashed potatoes are great.  Frites are ok (if you like crispy, then they are more than ok).  Very reasonable for the quality and taste of everything.  Not a cheap dinner, but a good one for the package.  Would definitely come back again."

They have no business calling it a French restaurant if they're going to mess with recipes that are 100s of years old and classic. The Steak Bordelaise was passable, but the Bordelaise was NOT authentically done. The frites were absolutely NOT done French style; they were potato chips. Well, what can you expect?

This is one of few if not the only patio restaurant located right on the strip.  We ate there before the sun went down and saw it all happen before are eyes.  The sun fell behind the Bellagio, the lights came on, the freaks came out!   \nAs far as the food goes it was top notch freaking mouth watering goodness.  Each byte of my steak was orgasmic!  I can't thank Joe (Friend/Waiter) for making the reservation for my wife and I enough.  \nFREAKING UNBELIEVABLE!  OH!\n\nOne little side story to tell. Before we sat down my wife and I had been standing at the outside patio for about 25 minutes.  We were getting a little tired from being on our feet.  The best table on the patio becomes free.  I think in my head that would be great to be seated there but at this point lets just get a table!  Then all of a sudden this business type tycoon dude comes strolling in with his business partner and just sits smack down at that table I was eyeballing.  They didn't even get seated from an employee.  I thought right away this dude is either an owner or knows someone.  A few moments later our buzzer goes off.  We then go back to the front of the restaurant to be seated back on the patio.  We actually wait another 5 minutes and then all of a sudden I see the business tycoon and his partner being told they must stand in line.  I chuckle to myself and tell my wife what I witnessed.  Finally a woman comes up to us and says allow me to take you to your seat.  We follow her back through the restaurant out to the patio.  The lady turns to me and says we have a really good table for you and your wife.  I turn to my wife as were walking and regurgitate what the lady says and roll my eyes.  We walk back out to the patio and low and behold we get seated at the table that business dude just got booted from.  I felt like we were high rollers!   My wife and I sat down, kissed, and smiled at one another and then proceeded to have a two hour meal of our lives."

He liked the pommes frites served on the side, while I would rather have had some other potato entree. They seemed like cheap filler for the plate to me. Skip the country pate (bland) and the cheese plate was uninteresting and the slices quite small. My son's French onion soup was presented beautifully but lacked the salty velvety texture of a good French onion. We had a few cocktails too. A standout was a good stout \"french manhattan\".

Perfect for a romantic dinner.\n\nI ordered the special of the night, prime rib served w potatoes au gratin and sting beans. CJ ordered the seafood platter. A combination of lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. Food came relatively quickly. Was all as expected. Taste was ok. 3/5. Which was a little disappointing considering the ambiance. Platter was also $24/person minimum 2. Considering, it was very little food for the price. Was more ice than anything else.\n\nWait staff was also peculiar. Waiter walks by. Makes eye contact. Then continues walking by. 10 minutes later he turns out to be the waiter. Now at chili's a chain restaurant, they would have typically said \"I'll be right back\", or otherwise indicate they were our waiter.  He was cordial and informative though. Food as said came out as ordered. But minutes later he is refilling our water. After a round or two, a bus boy finally starts refilling our water and removing plates. Overall the feel is poor staff training and disorganization. This place has one of the best locations across from the Bellagio fountains.\n\nOverall, great ambiance but food and service like a national chain restaurant. A shame because this place could be so much more. save yourself money and have drinks or dessert here"

The cool air from the restaurant was perfect to deflect the heat of the night! The fountains of Bellagio and the people on the sidewalk made for a perfect night. Our waiter was very stern faced, no smile but very informative and attentive. Our bus person was smiling and and great with water service and brought a complimentary appetizer and some bread. Our table had had a mishap prior to our seating and not all the spilled water had been cleaned up. Sitting in it was unpleasant and NOT being offered something to dry with by the waiter was unpleasant but thankfully the night air took care of that quickly! \n\nSalmon was good, a bit salty but the pea sauce was YUM YUM YUM! Burger with Blue cheese was tasty good. Wine and cocktails very good. Overall the atmosphere is what makes this sooo special. At the end of the evening, our waiter brought the bill and along with it an EAR TO EAR GRIN!"

As some people have mentioned, the hostess, reservation setup was not very friendly. They were almost robotic like, saying to go into the other line. Not the greatest first impression, but don't let that spoil the rest of the restaurant. \n\nThis is one of the first times that we were called up to be seated at the exact time of our reservation.\n\nWe were sat right by the Bellagio fountain view, it was perfect, and the temperature couldn't have been better. I had asked for this view when making the reservation, so make sure to do that. \n\nThe waiter came by, and was very nice and helpful. I ordered the Rib Eye, and my girlfriend ordered one of the other steaks. I had the French onion to start, it wasn't fantastic, but not too bad. Steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked Medium rare.\n\nI had told the wait staff ahead of time that it was my girlfriends birthday, and they brought her out a birthday cream puff, which was amazing and a very nice surprise for her. We also ordered the banana's foster crepe, and that was one of the most delicious crepe/deserts I have ever had. \n\nWe got to see the fountain show, had an amazing time, and the temperature was fantastic given the 103 degree weather outside. I would completely recommend this restaurant to anyone."

I really liked the grand marnier infused manhattan - a strong drink with just a touch of sweetness - very good. For dinner I had the pork medallions based on a recomendation. I was welcomed with the chef's carrot slaw and warm bread. The dinner was beautifully presented and delicious! The pork melted in your mouth and had a very flavorful wine sauce and was accompanied by an equally delicious stuffed tomatoe. The dinner was very reasonably priced.

If you aren't a local, or if it's the middle of summer, the patio may be a bit harsh until the sun drops behind the Bellagio, but the view is worth it if you can stand the heat.  The service is consistent and more than competent.  You can count on an amazing experience any time you come."

He  was probably the best server I've ever had-- incredibly attentive and nice.  \n\nI decided to order my go to dish- Eggs Benedict.  There is nothing better than breaking that yolk into the hollandaise sauce and soaking it up with the English muffin and ham.  I had to deduct a star because my English muffin was hard as a rock.  It was probably sitting on the hot plate for too long and got stale as it was waiting.  Other than that, the poached egg and sauce was great.  \n\nI also tried my friend's savory crepe and skinny pancakes.

The trips were back to back weekends and Mon Ami Gabi was one of the highlights of both trips!  \n\nThe first week we were able to get seats on the outdoor patio, the Bellagio fountains make for an excellent table side distraction when at a restaurant with an excited 4 year old. I was a little underwhelmed by my Steak Bordelaise, but everyone else RAVED about their steaks. The Frites and Escargot were excellent.\n\nThe second week with my girlfriends the wait for an outside table was 2 hours and we opted out of that, however they seated us on the inside where we could still see the fountains and amazingly the 28 year old women were as enthralled with them as the 4 year old had been the week before. This time I got the Steak Bernaise and it was so good! All the ladies loved their steaks as well, and for the price it really can't be beat. We each got an entree, plus 2 veggie sides, 2 apps and 2 bottles of wine to share at the table and our per/person cost was only $53, including tip. Can't be beat!"

I can safely say it is the best filet mignon I've had yet because of its merlot butter. I haven't found this sauce anywhere else so I praise its uniqueness. The filet mignon just melts in your mouth. Add a glass of merlot or cabernet and you have a blissful dinner listening to opera music from across the street. \n\nTheir spread for their bread is just delicious! It changes up but it's always unique and refreshing. I remember distinctly a sweet carrot sort of spread. yum. \n\nI miss the merlot butter filet mignon so much that I've tried recreating it at home.

We initially rejected MAG's $99 prix fixe deal but then went crawling back after calling place after place, demanding upwards of $1,000 PER PERSON.\n\nMon Ami Gabi rewarded our patronage with front-row seats to the Bellagio fountain show under comfortable heaters (keep in mind this was winter time!) on the patio.  The food was seriously plentiful and delicious.  I will never forget the escargot - it was simply to die for.\n\nOur most recent visit was last month.  Yes, our table was not in the ideal location (in the bar area) and we were seated next to a table of ignorant early 20's, probably having a first meal in a French restaurant (one guy told our waiter the French onion soup wasn't what he expected.  Really?  Because they do it real and delicious here.)\n\nMust haves: Baked cheese...downside - they don't give you nearly enough bread; scallop entree - you get FIVE large sea scallops (which is 2 more than most other places) which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and of course, their steak....I asked for the bearnaise sauce with my ribeye but in the end, hardly used any of it.  My steak was perfectly cooked and the leftover half of it tasted just as good (though a bit cooler) later that night.\n\nService was...interesting.  Very attentive but maybe a little smarmy.  Our waiter was French.  How original...a French server (with a French name) in a French restaurant.  Our table took bets on whether his accent was real or not.  Surprisingly, everyone thought it was fake!  None of us had the balls to really ask but it was entertaining and quite fun. He was a very nice gentleman and I would love to have him serve us again though I can't remember his name...Claude??\n\nMon Ami Gabi was our first love in Las Vegas and it will always remain dear in our hearts."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi was such a wonderful experience. On my trip to Vegas, we decided to eat at this particular restaurant because it was relatively close to where we were staying at and we wanted to try French food that didn't cost an arm and a leg. We stopped in on the Saturday lunch rush, and the wait wasn't too long. The hostess was very friendly and courteous. We requested to sit out near the patio, where it was nice and sunny, yet air-conditioned and hostess had no problem with that request. \n\nFor the appetizer my girlfriend and I ordered the escargot bourguignon and we decided to order some bloody marys that we could make at the bloody mary bar. The appetizers came in a timely fashion with a baguette. My girlfriend was kind of worried about eating snails because she has never had them before, but I told her that she wouldn't be disappointed. When the snails came out, the presentation was OK. I guess it was standard for that particular style of escargot. The snails were buttery, which is a good thing in my opinion! The basil sauce each snail came with was superb, perfect for dipping part of the bread into. The bloody marys consisted of top shelf alcohol, which we requested, and we were free to put whatever we wanted, which is expected at a do-it-yourself bloody mary bar. I wish it was an all you can drink bloody mary bar, but one can only wish... It was very good none-the less!\n\nOur entrees consisted of the mussels and gazpacho. The mussels were definitely good. The mussels were cooked perfectly, not rubbery or gritty that some lower end places tend to serve. The mussels were cooked in white wine and garlic, which is like pretty standard for mussels, but they where very large and meaty. What was especially good was that the white wine sauce tasted very good with the baguette that we got at the beginning of our lunch.\n\nFor Vegas, the food was very reasonably priced, even with the top shelf alcohol bloody mary bar. This place was much better than the overpriced MGM Grand Buffet that barely passes at edible!"

  "text" : "Fine dining in Vegas can be found pretty much everywhere, but this place was special for two reasons in my book: Flavor and the view! Now granted it was by luck that Bellagio's water show can be seen from the deck of this restaurant, but it sure makes for great dinner entertainment! \n \nWe went here at about 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon to have dinner before seeing a show, and I was impressed and let down in places, hence the 3 stars. Photos attached to my review of our food, but we had two \"house\" salads, split a seared salmon with my girlfriend and my mother had a jumbo crab cake plate. The salmon came in a green sauce with peas, and I was BLOWN AWAY! I usually eat salmon at restaurants so I have had my fair share, and this version was brilliant, best I have had in a while. The \"house salad\" I had on the other hand was overly seasoned with little to no leafy greens (see photo)... And the kicker, for this 6 bite salad, or \"Petite\" salad as they called it, 7$!!! Also, I tried the jumbo crab cakes of my mothers and they were neither \"jumbo\" nor that flavorful. My girlfriend also had a drink with Stoli vodka which was 8$, and she asked for Sky...    \n\nOverall it was enjoyable, mostly from the view, my salmon and the company I ate with, but as I said in the beginning, fine dining in Vegas can be found pretty much anywhere, and considering the amount (or lack there of for 3 people) of food / drinks we had, cost $75, I would try somewhere else..."

Forgot to call in for reservations, always call in advance for reservations by the way (it's crowded!) we came in at 730pm, for a party of 8, we waited for 30 min which wasn't too bad. We were glad we chose the outside seating. the view was amazing. we had the table right in front of Belagio water show. very nice seating. Most of us ordered either the new york steak or filet mignon- my friends had no complaint of the food. I ordered the salmon with spinach and walnuts- amazing!  I asked the waitress do they have anything special for my friends' bday, towards the end, she brought out a plate of vanilla ice cream cake, free of charge too. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was that it seemed like they were rushing us out.  We got the table around 815, and left before 10p.  The price is extremely decent for the quality of food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"

But in this pricy town, Mon Ami Gabi is a rare thing--a mid range priced restaurant with good quality food. Back home, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant but in Vegas it is the Americana version of classic French Bistro without breaking the bank. Did I mention those big, juicy scallops?

The service tends to be very attentive and the prices are not wallet busting unlike some of the other places around town. I would be hard pressed to say what may favorite meal is here- breakfast ,lunch or dinner. So I will include my favorites from each- for breakfast I like the breakfast specials- they usually have at least two -one sweet and one savory -a crepe with fruit or some sort of Eggs Benedict du jour for example. For lunch I love the croque monsieur- a french version of a grilled  ham and cheese sandwich but don't let the simplicity fool you it is TASTY. Dinner favorite is the roast chicken and frites. Nice view of the fountains at the Bellagio across the street if you get a seat on the patio, but unless you come at an off hour the waits can be long for seating anywhere in this place."

  "text" : "Oh mon ami! I wish I still spoke/remembered high school French! Or even better...I wished I was in France. Alas, Mon Ami Gabi will do. This petit French restaurant sitting outside - where else?!! - at the Paris Hotel!!! DUH!\n\nMy friends and I made reservation thru Open Table and were seated at our reserved time. We were smack centered in the patio (half-way outside) facing the Bellagio's water show. I'm sure it's even more spectacular at night. If you prefer to dine here for dinner, do make reservations!!!\n\nNow to breakfast/brunch ...there's nothing better than eggs benedicts (YAY POACHED EGGS!!!) with crab...which is why I was SO HAPPY I went here for brunch. I LOVE crab benedicts, which seems to be a popular dish since one of my friend's ordered it too - what a copy cat! Although, I think it was best she ordered her own because honestly, I wouldn't want to share :). My other friend ordered the steak. It looked good, but he did not want to share either. After we gave the waiter our order, he complimented us that we had made a good choice and asked if we had been there before. Nope, Mon Ami Gabi virgins - we just Yelp a lot.\n\nVerdict: My Crab Egg Benedicts were YUM! Loved them! If it was served for dinner, i would still order it :)"

The food is basic, but flavorful...and the service is always impeccable.  I've had most things are their menu, from crepes to burgers to salads to fish...and everything's been tasty.  They have an amazing wine by the glass list and lots of yummy cocktails (the French Martini is one to try!)...They also have perhaps the best bread and gooey butter anywhere outside of the real Paris.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out for lunch or brunch, when they have an awesome Make Your Own Bloody Mary Bar.  I haven't ever been for dinner, but I'm sure it would be great, too."

Started off with some cocktails (their french sangria was particularly notable as an interesting and simple choice).  Server was friendly, fellow long time local and Green Valley-ite.  All in all, food was good (enjoyed the Frisee salad the most), but, in my mind, nothing exceptional - 3 stars for food in my opinion (and I found things a bit pricey - but that is to be expected for a prime strip location run by a national restauranteur like Lettuce Entertain You - who needs to bring back Cafe Babareeba).  Extra star for the view (sat on the patio - only way to go here - between the misters and the setting of the sun - was quite tolerable on an August evening) and the quality of the people and strip-watching."

  "text" : "My second time at Mon Ami and it was still delicious. The restaurant has a patio area and an indoor seating area and is located in front of Paris Hotel. What's beautiful about patio seating is the people-watching and the water show at the Bellagio Fountain. A great way to start your day if you're looking for a brunch venue.\n\nSome awesome things to check out:\n\n-THE BLOODY MARY BAR: I've never seen a more awesome bar in my life. I've never had a bloody Mary before but the bar in the corner makes me want to start! I never realized that there were so many things you can add to your bloody Mary!\n\n-The brunch menu: Lose all of your money on that last hand at the blackjack table? That's okay! Items on the menu are $12 or less and are all super delicious!! What's more? You get bottomless bread and butter and the portion sizes are decent! A great deal for this type of dining atmosphere.\n\n-Get a CARAFE of their red sangria. Though the first time they had citrus fruits and herbs in the carafe, they had split grapes in the carafe this time around--the alcohol-infused grapes are super delicious! It's definitely worth it if you come in a group of 4-6. \n\nThe service is good and the food is great. Not bad for a place on the Las Vegas strip."

  "text" : "Went to Vegas with my parents as a final mini vacay before school starts. This time we went to Mon Ami Gabi for dinner to try the prominent Filet Mignon w/ merlot butter!\n\nWe made a Tuesday, 7:30pm reservation, which I'm really glad we did because it was pretty crowded around that time. We were lucky enough to get a table inside, but by the opening where we could still watch Bellagio's water show.\n\nThey give you a complimentary baguette with some type of seasoned radish/veggie thing on a separate plate. Interesting, but it wasn't anything that great IMO. The baguette was warm and fresh and the butter we slabbed on it made it a great starter to our dinner.\n\nHere's what we ordered that night:\n\n1. BUTTER LETTUCE & APPLE SALAD\n- Didn't try it, but my mom seemed to really like it.\n\n2. ONION SOUP AU GRATIN\n- So good, definitely one of the better french onion soups I've had. It wasn't too salty (which is a common issue most I've had) and the Gruyere cheese melted on top was divine.\n\n3. FRANGRIA\n- AKA 'French Sangria'. It was really good! I would get again and a glass of it is only $5.\n\n4. STEAK BEARNAISE\n- Tender, flavorful, good flavoring.\n\n5. FILET MIGNON W/ MERLOT BUTTER\n- Honestly the best filet mignon I've ever had. It's so tender that it melts in your mouth and that merlot butter sauce they put on it is godly. The frites were tasty and even better when they were sopping up the remaining merlot butter. MMMM!\n\n6. HANGER STEAK W/ MERLOT BUTTER\n- Tender and pretty similar tasting to the filet mignon (obv. because of the merlot butter). Honestly, I wouldn't mind just ordering this one since it tastes pretty much the same AND it's $20 (cheaper than the filet mignon).\n\nTheir prices aren't that bad when you look at the ambiance and quality of the food and service. Very impressive once again!\n\nTips/FYI's:\n- Make a reservation just to be safe!\n- Their patio seating has a beautiful view of the Bellagio water show, but you can't reserve a table there bc it's a first come, first serve basis :(\n- Since we went on a weekday, we noticed it wasn't very crowded around 8pm, so it might be easier to walk-in around that time?"

There are many more restaurants that I'd go to over this one that is more intimate and has better quality.  However, Vegas is replete with very disappointing dining - many are upscale and are gimmicky either in the food or in the \"atmosphere\" - what with moving walls, fire, etc.... anything to distract the fact that your food could be from a frozen dinner.  Not the case here at Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nThe quality is not that bad and at times very good but I cannot imagine cooking for a half dozen restaurants out of a central kitchen and those masses of people and making it possible to consistently turn out excellent food.\n\nOverall, we loved the food and will return..."

Obviously, I decided the latter and am glad for it.  More in the direction I wanted to explore, this beautiful brasserie's setting offered nice natural light and a spectacular view of Bellagio's Fountain promenade.  It doesn't take much imagination to romantically convince yourself you could be in a French café somewhere along the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.  Ambiance:  5 stars!    \n\nI ordered the Corned Beef & Poached Egg served with thick slices of incredible whole wheat toast.  Apart from the corned beef being on the greasy side, a rather tasty and nicely sized portion:  4.5 stars.  This along with my morning cup of Joe; I was set and ready to explore a full day's worth of Vegas!

  "text" : "I had the strangest night at Mon Ami Gabi but the food was so good I had to change in the car after dinner because my clothes were too tight. Forreal forreal.\n\nSo me and gf got seated next to some odd characters. On our left was a couple and it was clear the wife hated her life and wanted her husband to hate his too. One of those non-talking couples where it's so awkward you don't want to even say anything because you know they're listening. At one point the wife stuck her hand into her water cup, grabbed a bunch of ice cubes, and threw them on the table saying, 'there's too much damn ice.' WHO DOES THAT?! Eesh..hint to husband: DIVORCE IS THE ANSWER.\n\nOn our right were two men in their mid-sixties who were a bit overly friendly. Right when I stuffed my mouth with bread they turned to ask about what we were eating. Can't I just open my mouth and show you? It was actually comforting to have pleasant people sitting next to us though with the ice queen on the other side but being constantly interrupted when I'm EATING is a Mari no-no.\n\nGf and I spent the whole dinner trying to figure out if our waitress was a twin and if her sister worked there too, or if she was just one person. Different versions of our waitress would serve us- one with glasses, one without, one with a jacket, one without, and she'd change her hair too. We finally realized it was one person but gf swore she was doing it on purpose to mind f*** us.\n\nBUT ANYWAYYY.. the food. We decided go out straight after dinner and I had the bright idea of wearing a corset. I was cased up like a sausage..and still ordered the steak frites. Which was damn good, juicy and rare, even though I couldn't really breath. Bite, inhale, chew fast so I don't pass out. And their dirty martinis are smooth sailing. Our meal came out to about $90 something which is a little pricey but we got drinks so it's explainable. What I like about Mon Ami is that it's casual but still has that bistro charm.\n\nIt was worth changing in the car into something roomier, flashing the strip as we drove by. Who says looking like I'm about to have a food baby at the club isn't sexy?!?!"

For my main dish I couldn't decide on a steak but ended up with the STEAK AU POIVRE which was prepared perfectly. it was a nice large and flat piece which was so tender. I don't know how they did it but I get hungry thinking about it. Their frites were just as good. Mixed in with a couple glasses of champagne and wine and we had a perfect meal. The dessert was so so.

We arrived relatively early (before noon on a week day) and so there weren't that many people. I got the onion soup and the brie chicken crepe, and my friend got a sandwich that also had brie in it. The sandwich came with fries. The onion soup was flavorful and sweet, and I enjoyed it a lot. I also liked my crepe, the flavor was light but it definitely filled me up.

Mon Ami on the other hand  is affordable =)\n\nI took the BF here for a belated birthday dinner, made reservations thru Open Table and on the note part I had requested for patio table dining.  Call it being smart, I double checked with the restuarant the day of the dinner if they got my message and GUESS WHAT?!  I was told that even with the reservation, we need to come in 15-30 minutes earlier if we wanted guaranteed sitting out in the patio area.  What's the point of making a reservation if we had to do that?  I would've given this review a 5 stars if we didn't have to come in early.  We were able to sit outside and see the Bellagio Fountain show-- it's better to make your reservation at 8 P.M. if you want to wow effect.\n\nOn to the good part, in my head I wanted to order us the hanger steak and the medallion steak but I ordered the wrong one.  Instead, both of us had the steak au poivre.  We were both super hungry and had an early start with the alcohol that I didn't catch it till after I ordered.  I'm glad we didn't order any appetizers because they give you free hot off the oven french bread with butter and an amuse bouche.  \n\nWhen the steaks came out it was humongous!  It was almost the size of the whole plate.  At first, I thought the size would be to thin but it wasn't.  The steak was super moist   but I wish there was more sauce to dip in.  The BF says that the frites were super addicting and it kinda reminded me of \"Picnic\" potato chips.  BTW, if you don't want the frites I think you can ask for mashed potato for an additional fee.\n\nFor dessert, we had creme brulee and it was worth it.  Super smooth and love that burnt taste sugar!

But what blew me away was the steak bordelaise. I loveeee caramelized onions so when it's on anything, I really enjoy eating it. So what made the steak bordelaise was definitely the juicy caramelized onions with the steak. Great price for $25!!\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy with the rib eye was probably the bernaise sauce. I felt like it tasted a little bit bland and missing something. The steak was cooked well but I would say it was probably the sauce that was just ok. Price was $40 for not so big of a steak as well. But it's good overall and I'm sure some people would really enjoy it. Just wasn't for me. I would come back for the steak bordelaise. \n\nService was good. Food comes out at a decent time. And they give some small appetizers and yummy french bread. And for a formal dining restaurant. They take reservations for really big groups and really accomodating for that if you ever need to celebrate something. \n\nThe reason why it's only a 4 star is just that there is only 1 side with the steak. Altho they give really good signature hand cut fries fried thinly and goes well with the steak. It feels like you're eating the fries for days and just get sick of it after.

My girlfriends and I went to Mon Ami because it wasn't too expensive and we knew we'd be getting a pretty good meal. I guess I'll break it down by what each person got...\n\nGirlfriend #1\nHanger Steak with Mashed Potatoes (I uploaded a picture of it). This was pretty good, she ended up needing steak sauce but that's because she likes the tang of A-1 but I probably could have gone without it! The mashed potatoes were amazing!!\n\nGirlfriend #2\nHanger Steak with garlic spinach and the half order of mussels. The garlic spinach tasted like this dish my mom makes. Typically served in Korean restaurants but it was wayyy more mooshier, tasted good, but didn't like that it was so mooshy. The mussels are realllly good! The sauce was a bit salty so make sure you save some bread or ask for more! Really delicious!\n\nGirlfriend #3\nHanger steak with the fries (thinly cut potatoes that are deep fried not really fries) and a side of garlic spinach. She decided not to substitute her fries and she was glad she didn't. The fries really complimented her steak well. \n\nME!!!\nRose, French Onion Soup, and the Seared Salmon. The rose was good, you can never go wrong with a rose. The French onion was good but the broth was a little bit...sour?

It was too sweet (I guess it's hard to not make onion soup not salty since onions just get sweet when cooked) and sour...it was not the best. The seared salmon was served on top of a puree of green peas and although it was good and I ate all of it, I thought it was an interesting pairing. I don't know if I'd order it again...actually I probably wouldn't order it again nor would I recommend it. \n\nService is EXCELLENT!!!! The view (if you sit outside) is awesome since you get the watch the Bellagio watershow front and center! So I guess for that Mon Ami you get 4 stars from me. :)"

Mussels - Mussels were not fresh fresh but the white wine with herb sauce was flavorful.\n3. Seared Salmon - The sear was beautiful but the sauce needs work.  It lacked flavor and was to soupy.  I think the salmon would have been better without the sauce.\n4. Roasted Chicken - crispy herb skin and very moist inside.\n5. Hanger steak - cooked medium rare with merlot butter.  The butter was fantastic.\n\nOverall, I would come back to try there other dishes."

I could have done without the fake accents, but after a while it normalizes. For dinner I got the Seared Salmon. The sweet pea sauce is delicious. And to top it off, Bellagio Fountains are right in view. For dessert, stay away from the Apple Tarte, it was soggier than expected and the vanilla whip only made the sogginess worse. Would have preferred a scoop of ice cream or something similar. \n\nOverall, great place, great food, great atmosphere. Cafe Mocha is delicious too."

  "text" : "Part of the attraction for me to this place was the amazing patio seating that Mon Ami Gabi provides to you.  When the sprinkler system (aka misters) aren't on, it's quite nice to feel like you're sitting under the Eiffel Tower (albeit a fake miniature one) in a cafe beside the street.\n\nThe first thing I immediately ordered was a mimosa and eggs benedict.  The menu is pretty in depth and I was deliberating between the eggs or a crepe.  Ultimately I chose the eggs benedict.  Good choice in my opinion.\n\nThe mimosa is pretty damn strong.  I have a feeling that the orange juice is only in there for colour.  I personally asked for another glass of orange juice to dilute the mimosa a little bit.  Actually, the cool thing about asking for orange juice is that I got to make 2 mimosas for the price of one.  Score!\n\nThe eggs benedict was pretty good.  Nothing really too different about it.  I was pretty happy with how it tasted and thought it was pretty good.  The cool thing about their hash potatoes that they serve it with is that they put caramelized onions into it.  This kinda made it so that you didn't really want to put ketchup into it.  \n\nIn the never sleeping city of Vegas, it's nice to sit down and just have a nice breakfast every once and a while.  We all know how crazy it gets during the night, so it's a nice time to spoil yourself... and get drinking early =)."

Although there is an option for online reservations on the yelp page, please note this is for indoor seating only.  If you want the outdoor patio seating, probably best to come in at least 30-60min prior to the desired time to get on the list (maybe earlier during peak brunch hours on the weekend).  \n\nHaving dined for lunch inside and outside, the patio seating wins hands down by all accounts.  The lighting inside is great for a romantic evening dinner, but a bit too drab if you're trying to catch up with friends.  None of the lunch items blew me away, but the breakfast items were fairly solid and beautifully plated.  I would recommend any of the following best enjoyed with cup of coffee while facing the Bellagio fountains and observing the parade of characters lining Las Vegas Blvd.  \n\n1.  Blueberry waffles:  with a crisp exterior and pillowy soft interior, the belgian waffle is topped with fresh blueberries along with warm blueberry sauce and freshly whipped cream.\n\n2. Lemon pancakes: served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream over what is essentially a large French-style crepe with perfectly crisped edges and light as a feather, be sure to add a squeeze of fresh lemon before digging in.\n\n3. Seafood crepe: if you're lucky enough to be there on a day featuring this special, do not pass it up.  Large jumbo shrimp and scallops served atop a warm crispy crepe and topped with a creamy buttery white wine sauce served alongside fresh frisee and herbs.\n\nServers were attentive and very hospitable in snapping photos, which your visiting friends will be sure to request!"

  "text" : "So disappointed in Mon Ami Gabi. \n\nBased on the excellent reviews I was very excited to try Mon Ami. We made reservations to eat here on our last night in Vegas and were also celebrating my mother's birthday. I am not sure if MAG was just having an off-night but our experience was all around pretty terrible. The dinner started with a very chaotic and unorganized seating systems. Despite having reservations you have to stand and wait in a line to speak to the hostess. Then they have you stand aside in the crowded bar area and wait some more. Meanwhile, they call names but do it so quietly and from a different area that it is impossible to hear. All of this made for a stressful start to our dinner. Once seated we ordered drinks which were mediocre in preparation and mine came with a very long dark hair curled around in it and hanging out the side of my martini glass. Very disgusting and off-putting way to start the meal. We let the server know and he was not really apologetic at all and then brought back a new martini that was not prepared the way I had ordered. The waiter was incredibly inexperienced and told the table next to us that thier bottle of wine would cost \"whatever 12 times 4 is\". He then proceeded to break the cork into thier bottle of wine. We ordered appetizers that came out freakishly fast- within two or three minutes of ordering them. I had the house salad which was very small and had wilted brown lettuce in it. My mother had shrimp cocktail which was mushy and my father had french onion soup which was watery, had little or no onions in it, and had very little taste (my work cafeteria makes french onion soup that is WAY better). At this point with the combination of hair in our poorly made drinks, very disappointing food and terrible service, we decided to cut out losses and cancel our entree orders. \n\nOne star for the manager (I think his name was Constantine) who was very nice and apologetic and did not charge us for anything. \n\nAs a side note- we crossed the street and wandered into Caesar's looking for somewhere else to eat and got right into the Palm Restaurant (in the Forum Shops) with no reservations and had an excellent meal of lobster tail and steak!"

  "text" : "First time in a long time that I have been pleasantly surprised by a nice restaurant. MAG is, simply put, affordable fine dining.  Per fellow Yelper reviews, my parents and I had two of the filet mignon with merlot butter sauce- one medium and the other medium well. We also ordered the scallops.\n\nThe filet mignon was on point. My medium steak was perfectly tender. The med-well with a nice hint of char but not chewy. Deeee-licious. And the scallops? just divine. Melts in your mouth. It's a great place for an intimate dinner, although there's usually a line so get here early for dinner service or be prepared to wait a bit.\n\nMy only gripe was service. My family and I are not too big on alcohol-- and so we ordered sodas to drink.  I'm a firm believer in sensing that when a server thinks you have no money, they don't give you good service. My drink was never refilled after 30 min of being empty.  It was absurd. Our waitress checked on the table to my left. Then the table to my right. But never checked on my family and I again after setting down our entrees. Either because we didn't order alcohol, or being Filipino and not white, that we just weren't worth accommodating. I think this was unacceptable considering that the tables beside us are only 1-2 feet apart.  uhm... kinda hard to not notice when you're being ignored.\n\nAside from that, great food and I'd still recommend it. Our dinner between 3 came out to about $100 which was not bad... but you've been warned."

For a Vegas theme eatery, the interior is surprisingly classy and romantic, but the best seats as many have said are outside on the terrace overlooking the Bellagio water works. \n\nA supplemental gluten-free menu, which includes complementary g.f. bread with butter and (wonderful!) roasted olives, was most appreciated. The \"real\" wheat bread comes in a paper bag, which seemed a little odd and out of sync with the otherwise chic vibe.\n\nStarter of a frisee salad was a little disappointing, with the greens seemingly undressed and couched on a puddle of water. The rustic country pate was a delight though, very flavorable and on request served with triangles of g.f. toast. The main meals of frites, and steaks, were tasty, though my dining partner's was somewhat chewy though mine was tender.\n\nService was very professional and very French.

  "text" : "OK, first let's dispel the rumor that sitting across the street from the Bellagio fountains indoors or outdoors is a worthwhile experience.  Without the music the fountains are just a bunch of overgrown water sprinklers and, unfortunately, the music cannot be heard.  Even outside, the road noise and crowd noise from the restaurant drowned out the music.  So if you're going to go here, go for the food alone.\n\nExtensive and interesting menu and wine list.  We enjoyed the following:\n Beet and apple salad (complimentary) served with the French bread and butter.  Very good and quite interesting.\n Shrimp cocktail - very good\n Chicken liver pate with toast points, cornichons, olives, and pickled onions - great!\n Flat iron steak bordelaise - Good if you like bordelaise\n Fish and chips - wonderful and possibly our favorite dish\n Garlic Spinach - very good\n Frites - very good - a cross between potato chips and fries.  Must try.\n French onion soup - fair.\n Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - Excellent - some of the best we've had.\n House Merlot - average\n\nService was excellent.  Outdoor seating is fun for people watching but is first come first serve only.  Inner patio covered seating is same.  Indoor seating would definitely be my last choice and might not be a choice for us as there was a strong fish smell throughout the indoor areas.  In fact, it even drifted out onto the patio when we were first seated.  Hopefully a one time thing."

  "text" : "I am normally averse to eateries on the Strip because I am of the opinion that they tend to be more bark than bite, and prices tend to be inflated too. But after a long day of hiking, we wanted something close by, which is to say we were hungry, it was late, and options were becoming limited. So we settled on Mon Ami Gabi. I've stayed at the Paris before, and walked by this place many times, but it never really caught my eye. I'm glad it did this time.\n\nWe got here at 9:15 pm, with a reservation, but still had to wait 10 minutes or so, which wasn't terrible. The place looks like a French cafe, with incredibly tightly packed tables. There is a constant din from the other diners, and this being Vegas, the din is alcohol and tourist fueled. There was a table nearby of retirees singing Do You Know the Way to San Jose and another large table where some jackass kept dropping F bombs until he had food in his mouth. I kid you not. Ask for a seat on the patio, where you'll have a front row view of the Bellagio fountain. \n\nAs soon as you're seated, a baguette with whipped butter appears PDQ, but because it was so busy, the rest of the service tended to be a bit slow. Don't let that discourage you from coming here though! \n\nFor appetizers, we had the jumbo lump crab cake and mussels mariniere. The crab cake was literally just one little crab cake, served with a celery salad and a sauce gribiche, which is like an aioli. The gribiche was delicious, and the crab cake was decent, but was obviously overmixed. The lump crab was unmercifully beaten into shreds. The mussels however, were fantastic! They were huge, plump, and juicy, served in a delicious white wine and butter herb sauce. They must have been Mediterranean mussels, since blue mussels don't get this big. \n\nWe also tried the seared salmon and steak roquefort. The salmon was cooked to perfection, flaky, but still moist. I was impressed with their technique, though I am pretty sure it was farmed Atlantic salmon, as the flavor was tame. But still, it was a good piece of fish. \n\nBut this place is known for its steak frites, so I had to have a steak, and I chose the steak roquefort. All of the steak frites, save for those steaks specifically identified as another cut, are top sirloin, which for my money is among the beefier cuts of meat. Top sirloin is sometimes a bit tough, though not here. My steak was pounded so thin it only had one side to it! But it was amazingly moist and tender (ordered medium rare), and the roquefort sauce was packed with flavor. Each bite just melted in my mouth!\n\nWe finished our meal with a warm flourless chocolate cake, which was also delicious. Deeply chocolatey and moist, but light and fluffy, which is unusual for a cake of this type. It was served with a dollop of whipped cream and some berries, which provided a nice counterpoint to the chocolate.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the best meals I had in a while, and Mon Ami Gabi will become one of my regular haunts in Vegas."

I also lucked out because I go to sample his trout almandine, which was excellent. But as good as the fish was, I know I'd order the vegetable platter."

It was a nice palate cleanser and a surprisingly delightful gesture.  \n\nWe started with the Butter Lettuce and Apple Salad with Beets and Aged Goat Cheese and Onion Soup Au Gratin.  Then we shared the Smoked Salmon with Brioche and Creme Fraiche, and the Skate Wing with Garlic Potato Chips.  Everything tasted amazing!  \n\nWe sat on the patio directly across from the Bellagio fountains and we loved the ambiance!  As cheesy as a fake Parisian Eiffel Tower is, the restaurant has a really romantic vibe and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  \n\nTip:  The wait was an hour long for patio seating, so make reservations or be prepared to wait.  Good thing the pager works anywhere inside the casino!"

However, we had to wait an additional hour to get outdoor seating even though we had a reservation for 8:45pm on a Wednesday. Reservations are only for indoor seating and outdoor seating is first-come first serve.\n\nComplimentary french bread was served before our meals came out. It tasted freshly baked and it was a plus that it came out hot.\n\nI had the steak bordelaise and my wife had the special for the night. It was braised short ribs with mashed potatoes dressed with olives. She also ordered a carrot based soup as an appetizer. The meals were excellent and the portion sizes were large.  An excellent value for about $25 per dish.  The soup was $8 and it was also a large helping. \n\nFor dessert, we had the profiterole trio ($8) which includes vanilla, chocolate & strawberry ice cream over some kind of pastry topped with hot double chocolate fudge. The ice cream and fudge were delicious especially the vanilla. However, the pastry seemed a bit out of place in both taste and texture. All in all, the ice cream and fudge made up for the pastry. \n\nI recommend this place for great food at great prices. I also recommend getting a table outside if possible. I'm only giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of the long wait for outdoor seating even with reservations."

  "text" : "Pardon my French, but this place is the shizzz. There isn't a better restaurant on the strip that blends quality of food, service, scenery and ambiance. Just ate lunch here a little while ago. \n\nI ordered the Steak Frites. A staple dish of the restaurant that every other table had someone eating. Its a thin steak rich in flavor alone, but amplified by one of their 4 signature sauces. The waiter recommended the bordelaise sauce, caramelized onions in a red wine sauce. Great pick, it was amazing. Next time I will try the brandy peppercorn sauce! Other dishes at my table were the warm chicken and brie sandwich and the prime steak sandwich. Both looked delicious, particularly the Chicken and Brie.\n\nThe cool thing about this restaurant is that it is in the Paris hotel overlooking the Bellagio across the street. You can eat outside on the elevated patio away from all the foot traffic. So while you are eating a beautiful meal, you are at the same time in the middle of the strip possibly watching the Bellagio water fountain show. \n\nThe food, service and scenery causes sensory overload. Bring your date here if you want to seal the deal."

We had a reservation for the outside patio and upon arrival were told they don't reserve outside tables.  We were told in an abrupt and negative manner that we'd have to go back outside and put our name in at the end of the list of walk ins if we wanted a table outside.  Also, most of our party had arrived and they rudely refused to seat us and promptly gave our table away.  We could understand that policy, but it would have been much nicer had they offered us a seat in the bar while we waited.  There were 5 women working the hostess desks and they were all equally abrupt and inconsiderate.  This lack of friendly service pretty much ruined our experience."

On top of location, the service and food is one of the BEST on the strip! This place is wonderful for breakfast and lunch. Never been for dinner so I can't speak for their dinner menu. A wonderful place with awesome food.\n\nThe only thing keeping this from a 5 star review, was the hostess's at the door.

The restaurant was set in a romantic mood, but definitely a lot of tables around. We got seated right in front of Bellagio's water fountain inside, but unluckily, it started to rain so people outside have to kind of scoot the table in and ours were getting splashed by the umbrellas :[ \nI had one of the steak dish, it was cooked medium rare just like how I ordered, but it was a bit heavy on the salt. The meat was a bit chewy once it got cold, so I didnt really want to finish. The \"fries\" were different, it was interesting. I just wish i had some ketchup to have with it. \nIt's a great view and romantic setting, but food was just so so. My cousin seemed to like her scallop dish a lot, but the soup of the day that we had was a cold soup. None of us liked it, we literally each tried a spoon of it and sent it back. I guess we're just not used to cold soup. \nService took a bit long since it was pretty crowded. \nDid not get a chance to try their desserts, I wouldn't mind coming back one day to do so, just not for a full meal."

It seems like every time we come to Vegas we end up here for atleast one meal, even though the food is normally not the best part. The ambiance, view, service and definitely the value are what keep bringing us back again and again. Prices here are very reasonable for food on 'The Strip'. Especially considering the abundance of overpriced, mediocre food paired with poor service that seems to be in abundance in Vegas.\nNestled in the base Eiffel Tower structure located @ the Paris Hotel & Casino, you can enjoy a relaxing meal while looking out at the famed Bellagio water show and pretending your someplace charming in the real Paris, France.\n\nDinner begins with complimentary fresh baked Baguette, Butter and a julienned fresh Carrot, Apple & Beet starter that are delicious.\n\nAppetizer:\n\nSteak Tartare ($17.95) - Order off menu and made with the filet cut this dish was amazing. Served with Country Toast, Cornichons, Pearl Onions, Whole Grain Mustard and fresh Chives. \n\n\nEntrees:\n\nSeared Scallops w/ Mushroom Veloute & Grilled Asparagus($21.95)  - Sadly this dish was disappointing. The Scallops were terrible. Bland, under-seared and rubbery. The mushroom veloute was good but couldn't revive the flat Scallops.\n\nBraised Lamb Shank w/ Orzo Pasta,Goat Cheese, Black Olives and Cherry Tomatoes ($32.95) - Special of the night and my 2nd favorite dish after the Tartare. Lamb was falling offa the bone tender and flavor packed and the Goast Cheese w/ Orzo Pasta was the perfect partner. Amazing.\n\nSIdes:\n\nFrites ($4.95) - French Frites served in a cone and shaped in ribbons. Salty, crispy, hot and complimented the Mushroom Veloute and the Braised Lamb Shank perfectly. You can't go wrong with fried food.\n\nDessert:\n\nProfiterole Trio w/ Chocolate, Vanilla & Strawberry Ice Cream ($7.95) -The Ice Cream wasn't fresh and had ice chunks in the the Strawberry portion but the Profiterolles covered in chocolate sauce were delicous.\n\nOverall we experienced what we have grown to expect at Mon Ami Gabi which is some really good food mixed with some mediocre dishes. \nWhy come back then you might ask? For the view, the service and the value. Oh and did I mention the view?"

First of all, don't let them trick you into thinking the last three salads are entree sizes.  I asked them about the seared ahi tuna salad size and they said it was entree size.  What I received was about 4 slices of seared tuna and maybe about 10 bites of greens.  Boy, did I need another \"entree\"  or maybe it was the wicked spoon buffet that stretched out my tummy.  I also ordered warm chicken with brie with french fries.  Their french fries were thin almost like chips rather than french fries, which I was disappointed with.  The sandwich was good but needed more chicken so that the sides can have more than  just bread and onions.  Seriously, for $13 they should be able to put a bit more chicken.  The steak frite was not bad but not great either."

This was the first time that I've eaten here twice in one trip, and that's a great thing!\n\nFor my first visit I treated my mom out for dinner, which would be the first in a series of treats for her (followed by Bouchon and RM Seafood).  Patio Dining of course.  The weather was gorgeous and we had a great view of the Fountains of Bellagio.\n\nI ordered their Seared Atlantic Salmon which was cooked good and really tasty despite its simplistic presentation (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=U9uc4zMFj4pWaez_cKWYcw).  But sometimes less is more!\n\nI was really jealous of my mom when I saw her Trout Amandine with toasted almonds, haricot vert, tomato, and brown butter (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=hIVN3kXbY2-PRPbwMHJN-g).  It looked really amazing!  And I knew she loved it!\n\nFor my second visit, it's become a tradition for me to have breakfast here before I fly back home, so that's exactly what I did for the third consecutive time.  Since I didn't have a chance to order any steak my whole trip, I decided to go with the classic Steak & Eggs (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=80uPZHrtVgfiKBZDx8djaA).  The Steak was cooked perfectly and same went with the Eggs.  And their Hash Browns never disappoint.  Definitely hit the spot for me, and was a great way to finish off another Foodie Trip in Vegas.  \n\nAnd as expected with both visits, the service was just incredible.  Both waiters I had for each service were very attentive and helpful, and the water and food servers were on top of their game.  A very well oiled machine!\n\nYou can see why this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and why I keep coming back.  It's just the perfect spot.  Till next time Mon Ami Gabi!"

Boyfriend's dish. So glad we switched the sauces! The peppercorn sauce is so tasty, the sauce complements the steak very well. It comes with a side of fries that are more like chips! it's so crunchy, my boyfriend finished his whole portion.\n\nSea Scallops - My scallops could have been seared a bit more brown, but still well cooked. It came with a side of asparagus and butternut squash puree. The puree was just okay, not as flavorful. I used my boyfriends peppercorn sauce to make up. :p\n\nSteak Bordelaise - i tried this dish from my friend and YUM! The onions were very sweet and savory. Really good balance with the steak.\n\nI was able to try most of the other sauces and they were all very tasty.

No problem, you get a beeper and it works anywhere in the casino/vicinity, so we could gamble or hang at a bar in the hotel.  After 10 minutes of waiting, I needed to run to the room to grab something, thinking we still had at least 30 minutes.  While I was gone, the beeper went off and my husband went to get our table.  They were really difficult wtih him, saying that he couldn't sit down until I was there, too.  My husband essentially said, \"she'll be right back, I'll wait for her at our table\", and didn't take no for an answer, so they sat him.  I was back in 10 minutes, but my husband was going to go ahead and order a bottle of wine for us, but the server never stopped at the table until I got there!  Not sure if he was just that busy, or if they were trying to prove a point about our entire party not being there, but at any rate, it kind of sucked.  \n\nWe had a great bottle of French chardonnay and a loaf of their hot french bread.  The bread was awesome but sitting outside, it was so hot that the pot of butter completely melted!  Most of the tables had umbrellas and were shaded, but were sitting right in the sun and we were burning up.  I had a salad and my husband had the mushroom soup to start, the soup was amazing.\n\nFor entrees, I had a cold crab and shrimp salad sandwich, served with homemade chips.  It was wonderful, nice and cool and refreshing when sitting in the hot sun!  Delicious.  \n\nMy husband had the croque monsieur with fries.  The fries were tiny strips of potatoes, fried until crispy, and really good.  His sandwich was good, but a little boring.  There is normally more bechamel sauce on a croque monsieur, this was pretty dry with very little sauce, but it did have nice flavors.\n\nOverall, great lunch.  It was hot, so if you get stuck sitting in the sun, you might be miserable (I have no clue how people eat here in the middle of summer!), the view is amazing! I really want to come back for dinner, when it's cooler, and the Bellagio fountains are all lit up."

Despite the fact that we had a reservation, we had to wait in a long, long line - one that was longer than the line for people without a reservation. Does this make sense? Okay, we wait patiently. We ask if we could be seated outside. The wait is an hour and a half. Okay, we opt for inside, take our pager, and head to the slots. Lo and behold, 15 minutes later we are paged and then inexplicably seated OUTSIDE! Call it beginner's luck. And what a great view of the Strip all abuzz with activity, and a great view of the infamous Bellagio fountain just behind the palm trees! Perfect. \nThe food? The endive, pear & bleu cheese salad was delicious, and the ribeye on the bone was cooked a perfect medium rare. The frites were a cross between a french fry and a potato chip. Addictive, but we had to save room for dessert. Profiteroles were freshly assembled - a perfect rendition of the bistro classic. Cocktails and wines with entree and dessert were perfect as well.\nWe lucked out with a dynamite server named Dawn! She was always right on top of things. All told, a perfect start to our Vegas weekend! The prices were not out of the ordinary for any good restaurant in Vegas. The only strange thing that happened was that I later received an email from Open Table saying that Mon Ami Gabi had cancelled my reservation - AFTER we had already dined there. Ah well, just a technical glitch that didn't change our experience in the least. Bravo, Mon Ami!"

Came with yummy buttery brioche and assembled by yourself with some creme fraiche, capers and onions,\n\nCoffee & Orange juice were $4 each. which is pricey considering their entrees were only bout $10.

Waiters were also very accommodating and explained the specials for the night."

  "text" : "How many times have I walked right past Paris?  Too many and I won't next time I go to Vegas.  I got stuck in Paris when my room at Ballys wasn't ready or reserved for me.  I found out about this place reading an article about George Wallace, who said he liked to eat here and people watch, loved the prommes frites and steak.  I made a reservation and that's what I had, along with some very good escargot, wine, creme brulee for desert, and of course wine.  My waiter really was French, polite, prompt and attentive.  The food was excellent I have no complaints, in fact I came back the next night and waited for a table outside.  Unlike others I could actually hear the music across the street while watching the light and water show.  Again, the service was prompt, escargot wasn't as spicy as the night before, and I went with scallops which was just as delicious as the steak.  Also, I tried their saute'd brussel sprouts, delicious, the leaves are separated and saute'd in butter, quite tasty and the only way I will ever eat this vegetable.  I'll be back here to dine next week for sure!"

  "text" : "Now this review is truly overdue.  I went to Vegas months ago, but never got the chance to finish this review.  With a Vegas trip possibly in the near future, I thought it pertinent I got this one out.    \n\nWith reservations placed online, we didn't have to wait.  Located right in front of the Paris Casino, you can't miss it.  An exposed patio section displays itself to the Strip.  I was in debate whether to have lunch or dinner here and since our schedule forced us to choose dinner.  Dinner it was.  The lighting is dimly lit and has a romanticized atmosphere layered with a generally casual ambience.  \n\nLooking through the menu, Bun and I had no idea what to order.  Thank goodness, we had a Hank Azaria for our waiter.  It wasn't really him, but it really looked like him.  If you don't know who that is, he's most known for voice acting numerous characters on The Simpsons such as Chief Wiggum and Moe.  He played the French guy Ben Stiller's movie wife had an affair with in Along Came Polly.  Coincidentally in that movie, the scuba instructor he plays is French.  My eyeballs opened a little bigger in shock when the first words laced with his French accent popped out.  That waiter whose name I do not recall will be called Hank for remainder of this review.    \n\nAfter sifting through the entire menu, we both ended up choosing steaks with frites.  There seemed to be a crazy number of different choices of ways they prepared steaks that I had no clue what they were.  Hank gave us a full detailed debriefing for each kind and how they were cooked.  I was certainly impressed.  He also gave us the option to make the steak a filet mignon instead.  That was a no brainer.  \n\nAs our starters, Bun ordered the soup du jour which came in and was served out of a curiously interesting jug.  It was then poured onto the plate which had a little cream in the center.  I wanted to originally get a regular salad, but he convinced me to order the frisee and bacon salad.  Hank said it was a very common salad in French cafes in France.  I guess I played sucker to that one and yielded to his request.  This salad had a poached egg, bacons slices, and caramelized onions.  He even showed me how you're supposed stir the egg evenly through the whole salad before eating it.  The salad was simply marvelous.  I sampled some of Bun's soup and it had nice level of creaminess and was really good.   \n\nWhen our filet mignons came, my mouth instantly watered like Homer Simpson when he sees a donut.  It was tenderness on blast.  Cooked to a nice medium rare as requested and served with a side of frites, it filled my stomach up to the brim.  I was really surprised considering the prices.  To not over exceed one's expectation, this wasn't $200 Kobe beef.  That would be an unfair comparison.  Yet this filet mignon was excellent enough with its simple design to easily deliver the same goal.       \n\nWhile holding our full stomachs, Hank comes over to offer a dessert menu or some coffee.  I don't even remember responding back.  I think my stomach said something on the line of needing the bill so we can roll our full buttocks out.  Obviously, by now one can tell my impression of their service was very gracious and cordial.  The food was more than just reasonable.  It was a good, unadulterated, affordable Vegas meal.  A return visit is in the horizon."

Our food was brought to the table in 15 minutes. This was shocking considering it was a busy Friday night. My salad was subpar. My bf's steak was bland and well done, not medium like he ordered. In addition to that the waiter saw my boyfriend's napkin on the floor and just picked it up and put it on his lap instead of giving him a replacement. \nAfter a few bites of the steak my bf asked the server for a new york strip steak instead. Again the steak came out shortly after his request, and it was charred black all over! My bf was really upset and told the server there was no way he was going to eat his food and just wanted the bill. At this point the server seemed semi apologetic and said he would send the manager to address the matter. The manager came over and apologized and offered free dessert. We declined. The server came back saying that the manager wan't going to charge us for anything and hoped we would come again. Ha, fat chance!\nOne star is being given because we were seated with a great view of the bellagio fountains."

We had our neighbor diners gapping at the tray full of seafood they brought us.

Unfortunately they don't take reservations for outside dining, so you may have a little bit of a wait, but next best thing is to sit at the bar, it's sort of outside/inside so you get the best of both worlds."

My heart told me to go with the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter but my tummy went with the Steak Berlanaise because I was craving onions (who craves onions? Vegas does weird things to me). The other girls went with the scallops, salad, mussels, skate fish, and burger. I had a bit of the scallops which were really good and nicely portioned. The mussels looked like a good amount too as well as the skate fish that my friend couldn't finish. The salad also looked pretty appetizing albeit small but was only $9! The cheeseburger was sizable as well so portions are pretty decent here, especially for the price of the food.  The fries that came with most of the entrees were disappointing. They weren't so much fries as they were little potato chips. Wah. Loved the warm fresh baguettes we were served in the beginning of our meal!

  "text" : "OK, I admit I'm attracted to any restaurant styling itself a French Bistro, let alone at the Paris in Las Vegas. And when I'm famished, I go directly for my favorite French comfort food -- Steak Frites! Hence my visit to Mon Ami Gabi this week, where I took little note of anything else on the menu and ordered this house specialty.\n\nAt MAG, the signature \"Steak + Frites\" bears little resemblance to its ubiquitous French namesake, as it's a pounded, \"triple tenderized\" paillard of sirloin covering most of a steak platter and topped with crisp fried ribbons of potato that were difficult to eat gracefully. Amazingly, the chef managed to flash grill it to my specified \"rare\", but my steak knife really got a workout with the sinews throughout the meat. There was a tasty \"amuse bouche\" to start (with an extra serving offered by my stellar server Missy), a delicious mini-baguette that would delight most and a very nice wine list by both the glass and bottle.\n\nThe patio would always be my choice for dining here, weather permitting, and it's heated in season. With its view of Bellagio's Dancing Waters complete with audible music, this is a good spot for an enjoyable Las Vegas evening meal, but if I were you, I'd order something else. Most around me did and seemed to enjoy their choices. Bon Appetit."

We were expecting a loud hustle and bustle type restaurant but found it to be quiet and intimate. We had reservations and were seated promptly upon checking in. We could tell that the food was going to be amazing just from the aromas around us. Our waitress was very attentive and open to making recommendations. We both ordered the hanger steak and were happy with our choices. The merlot butter on the steak was delicious! We split an order of mac and cheese and loved it - so rich and decadent. The only minor complaint was that our entrees came with a lot of fries. They were yummy but just too much. We will definitely be coming back for dinner on future trips to Vegas. Oh...we were informed that they serve breakfast. I can imagine how good the breakfasts are. Hated the breakfast we had at The Sugar Factory so this might end up being our future breakfast place."

We ordered baked goat cheese as appetizer and my bf got a pan seared atlantic salmon and I got a bordelaise steak.

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi was good, but not amazing. I went for dinner w/ my parents & and aunt and uncle. My aunt has Celiac, so she is on a gluten-free diet. They do provide a gluten free menu, and do a good job preventing cross-contamination, as she didn't get sick afterwards.\n\nThe meal was nice. I had a steak roquefort and it was quite delicious. I'm not necessarily a big steak eater but here they pound them thin before adding a sauce. My dad had the poivre which he enjoyed and my mom had the sea scallops which she loved. My uncle enjoyed the rib eye, and my aunt had filet mignon. Between us, we drank 3 bottles of wine. They have a fairly large selection, but it isn't very imaginative. Not many that were unheard of.\n\nThe dinner was for both my dad and aunt's birthdays. They brought out small cakes (gluten-free for my aunt)  for each of them. It was good, nothing special, but the thought was quite nice. I had the banana fosters crepes, which were amazing. The table also enjoyed creme brulee, chocolate pudding cake, and the chocolate mousse.\n\nThe downside for me was the ambiance. For the money you are paying for dinner, sitting inside was a bit loud. We were seated next to a register, and the wait staff wasn't too shy about talking near us. If you can, get a seat outside on the patio. They keep it well heated in the winter, and you have an amazing view of the fountains at the Bellagio."

For those wanting to forgo the dark, atmospheric inner room for the bright, light buzz of the other dining areas, be ready to wait the standard 20 minutes. \n\nI love that the interior does actually feel a little French, if not a little Disneyesque-French. The service is thoroughly American: friendly and completely casual. The food seems to be a hit-or-miss. And the lunch menu is not too exciting for food lovers.\n\nOur appetizers--baked cheese and onion soup au gratin--were filling, hearty and verrrrrry tasty! Our mains offered a totally different experience. The croque monsieur, sadly, was not at all hearty or rustic. If you're hoping it'll be an oven-toasted pairing of tasty French bread and gorgeous ham, don't. It's basically sub-par toasted ham and cheese sandwich, storebought sliced bread to boot. The steak sandwich was flavorful but already cold upon arrival. Fries here are unique. They are so thinly sliced that they're actually like chips/crisps--not like what I remember of bistro fries in France.\n\nGo here for the cute outdoor and conservatory seating, and view of the Bellagio fountains. Food is decent and filling--but nothing to write home about."

The atmosphere is perfect, service is always good and the food is delicious.\n\nMy boyfriend & I decided to have our anniversary dinner here out of allllll the Vegas restaurants simply based on the ambiance. The outdoor seating is the best (hello, Bellagio fountain show!) but be prepared to wait because they only accept reservations for their indoor seating. For such a popular restaurant with an amazing location, the price point at Mon Ami Gabi is totally reasonable. The restaurant falls between a casual/lively/family setting and an intimate/date setting.\n\nThe Pear & Endive salad, Trout Amandine and Classique Steak Frites we ordered were on point. I seriously cannot get enough of their Frites! It's the perfect cross between crunchy potato chips & fries....so addicting. The service was really welcoming & not pretentious at all. I was even surprised to see our waiter open a brand new wine bottle for me at our table when I only ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio...impressive.\n\nBrunch here is delicious as well...I love their Quiche! And if you've ever been curious about Escargot, I would recommend ordering it here only because it's drenched in garlic & parsley...not as scary as one would think ;)"

Everything was great, I had eggs and hash browns and my wife had crepes. Mmmmmm! The fruit platter with creme fraiche and mint syrup on the side was a great way to end our brunch. The staff were very nice and helpful and knowledgeable. The food was so delicious we decided to have our last dinner there, which between my wife and I is very rare since we love to try new restaurants every chance we get and there sure is a huge variety to choose from there in Las Vegas. Dinner for two with appetizers and a bottle of wine was very reasonable and the food soooo delicious. Try the French Onion Soup, best I've ever had. Complete dinner for two with a shared dessert and a shot of espresso was well south of two bills. Coming from San Francisco, this caliber of restaurant would have been over two bills.\n\nYou gotta make reservations if you want to be seated right away. The best part, it was so easy to do so over yelp, made our reservations the same day a few hours before we went. This was on a week day so I recommend advanced reservations on a weekend or busy day."

It was a chilly night, but the heaters kept us nice and toasty.\n\nService: This was our first meal that entire day, so we were FAMISHED. As a result, we asked for bread refills three times, and even then our server was still very patient and pleasant. The place was pretty busy, but we got seated very fast :). The place is huge!\n\nFood: I got the Thanksgiving set meal, which came with oysters and smoked salmon for appetizers, turkey for entree, and pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.

Usually at nice restaurants you receive above adequate service. I have actually had better service at my local IHOP that I received that night. Which was a complete and total bummer.\nUnfortunately this isnt even the worse event of the evening. \nSo, they're having a special that consisted of bacon wrapped sea bass. They had me at sea bass and put the cherry on top with bacon. Half way through my fish I notice that the middle of the sea bass steak is actually completely UNCOOKED! \nAt first I think i'm imagining things so I have my dining mates look and sure enough.. uncooked! and not a small amount but a pretty substantial portion of meat. \nI call my waiter over and he does take it back and has the chef finish cooking it but It was all too much for me. \nIm not sure when I will be back.

The meal started off with some nice sangria, a delicious baguette, and french onion soup, but went slightly downhill.\n\nFrangria - If they're known for sangria, I am going to try it, and this place delivered on it. It was nicely sweet with all of the fruit bits soaking in it but still strong enough. I just wish it was a bit cheaper.\n\nFrench Onion Soup - This was the standout of the meal. It had plenty of onion flavor and a huge helping of Gruyere cheese! I actually really loved this and another bonus is that it's huge. It definitely feeds two people, no problem. \n\nSteak Bearnaise - The steak was chewy to the point that both the bf and I had to spit out a couple of pieces. The Bearnaise was actually cold, and from my understanding, it is supposed to be served room temperature. It wasn't very flavorful either. The frites that came with them were unexpectedly thin, but quite good. They reminded me of those little fried potato matchsticks you can buy in a tin from supermarkets. Ahh childhood nostalgia.  \n\nSea Scallops (entree) - I had actually ordered the appetizer version, with caramelized fennel and onion marmalade, but they mixed up my order and out came the entree with butternut squash puree and brussels sprouts. The scallops were cooked very well but everything else on the plate was not great. Perhaps this is because I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts. Also, the butternut squash puree was light and not an overpowering flavor, but again, didn't enjoy it so much.\n\nThe staff here was wonderful and thankfully they didn't charge me extra for the mix up. The waitress did ask if I wanted to send the scallops back for the actual appetizer but I thought I would give the entree a shot. I must say I regret that a bit.  \n\nI may give this place another shot in the future, but for now, my only recommendation for this place would be the bread, french onion soup, and sangria. Also, make a reservation ahead of time as this place can be pretty busy."

The food MUST be laced with crack or something because the minute I left I immediately went into withdrawal.  I was in Vegas with some girlfriends and one of them had eaten here before.  She highly recommended it so we decided to give it a try.  I think we got there, say...around 12:00pm.  Maybe not the best time since 12 noon is universal lunch time.  Anyway, we get a buzzer, are told that it might be a 30 minute wait, and proceeded to peruse the menu.  Bad idea.  30 minutes felt like 30 hours after greedily seeing everything that was on the menu.  After what seemed like an eternity, our buzzer happily vibrated and we practically ran inside the restaurant.  Speed is not something that is highly valued here.  So let's just say that we probably waited a good hour for our food.  BUT!  But, my friends, we were prepared.  We each ordered either their mushroom soup or french onion soup.  Now, I'm not a big french onion soup aficionado, but this soup came w/ GLOBS of cheese.  I'm talking about just getting a chunk of it and throwing it in that bad boy.  Um..yeah, I was licking the cheese off the side of the bowl. And I wasn't alone.  The WARM french bread LOAF that they brought to the table was excellent.  I really had to restrain myself from not devouring the entire thing, we were so hungry!!!!  And finally, after staring every waiter down, after thinking that every tray was making its way to our table, we got our food.  I've never had french cuisine before and leave it to me to order the only non-French item on the menu: a bacon cheeseburger.  But it was topped with an egg!  Isn't that how the French eat it?!  No?  Oh.  Anyway, this burger made me want to cry, sing, dance, make love to it, yell at it for cheating on me with other patrons, stalk it on facebook, etc.  My friend sitting next to me ordered their seared ahi tuna burger and she was in heaven.  But alas, I was ill prepared for the culinary greatness that I was about to encounter.  One of my friends ordered their Steak Classique.  And...AND!...she ordered it medium rare.  When I took a bite of that steak, I swear I saw the second coming of Christ, because this HAD to be the end of the world.  I closed my eyes, bowed my head, and thanked God for letting me experience this moment.  Words cannot explain the series of emotions I felt after biting into this steak.  It's really not fair for food to taste this good.  I'm actually getting quite angry.  Damn steaktease.  The only negative (if you can call it that) that I'm giving belongs to...sigh...the frites.  Yes, they're labeled as french fries but they were straight up potato chips.  Now I love potato chips as much as the next man, but when I'm in the mood for FRENCH fries, I want my FRENCH fries, ya know?  Oh :(  But how can I stay mad at you, Mon Ami Gabi.  You are the perfect lover."

With all of the amazing restaurant options Vegas has to offer, I can't justify giving this place a 4 but I would rank it as a 3.5. The food is solid and the price point is very fair for a restaurant on the strip with such a great view.\n\nI came here for lunch and there's a nice selection of crepes, sandwiches, and lunch entrees. The french fries here are the super thin crunchy kind so that was one of my favorites."

It reminded me of typical food you could get from a chain restaurant, but it was in no way bad. I love how the restaurant is right in front of the Bellagio hotel so you get a great view of the water show every 15 minutes. The restaurant is also very dimly lit and romantic. The .5 stars off was mainly for the slow service."

My husband ended up ordering a spinach/mushroom crepe, which the kitchen made for him without any hassle. I had the mushroom quiche. We would say that the food was probably an 8/10, with the desserts both being highlights. The service was wonderful - brisk and friendly, but not overly intrusive. Solid ambiance - darker woods and a lovely sun room that lets in a lot of natural light during lunch."

  "text" : "I had heard great things about this place and finally decided to try it for my husband's birthday weekend. It was fantastic! We ate outside on the patio around 10pm on a Friday night and it was still fairly busy. It was cold, like 40 degrees, but the patio had heaters everywhere and that made it comfortable enough to eat (with your coat on). It is arguably one of the best outdoor eating spaces on the strip. You can easily see the fountains of the Bellagio shows and watching the people on the strip is always entertaining. In fact, next time my friends and I are going to play some people watching Bingo while eating dinner here!\n\nWhile Mon Ami Gabi could rely solely on its location, the food is actually quite delicious and the service was fantastic. My husband had the bone in rib-eye steak and it was cooked perfectly for him. The Bearnaise sauce was lemony and a perfect compliment to the steak and a great dipping sauce for the frites. Oh the frites! They don't look like much at first but they have the flavor of a fry with the crunch of a chip! A delicious pile of perfection. \n\nI had the chicken Paillard with their mashed potatoes. The waiter suggested one of us try the mashed potatoes instead of both of us getting the frites and I was so thankful for that recommendation. The mashed potatoes were impeccable. I think I ate almost the entire pile before my husband got a bite. They were creamy and delicious and most likely overlooked since everyone raves about the frites. The chicken was also very good and served with fresh lemon and herbs. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience. The service was some of the best that I have ever received, our server was funny and made helpful suggestions. The view was fantastic and the food was delicious and affordable by Vegas standards. We will definitely be back!"

  "text" : "For our third night in Vegas, we headed to Mon Ami Gabi.  Now I wasn't quite as excited as my friends because we have one at home in Bethesda.  They sat our group in the patio room which had a great view of the Bellagio water show.  It was exceptionally dark though.. so much that we needed to pull out our cell phones to read the menu.  Mood lighting I suppose.  Our waiter was full on with the theme and right off the boat from France.  He might as well have been named Pierre, wore a beret and a little scarf, and had on a black and white striped shirt.  It was really too cute.  I was SUPER disappointed, however, when he told me that the only duck and lamb options were available on a single day of the week... not Saturday.  I considered having Chilean sea bass for a third night in a row, but instead went with the Seared Atlantic Salmon with pommes purée, mushrooms, pearl onions, red wine sauce for $19.95.  It was a great sized portion and they cooked the salmon to perfection (extremely rare).  My friends ordered the brie (which I'm never a fan of) and the mac and cheese for side dishes.  I was not impressed with the mac and cheese and stopped after a small bite.  It tasted like anything I could have made at home.  Nothing special.  My adorable waiter does get extra points for helping me to select a great wine that fit my taste buds.  He also explained the difference between French and South American Sauvignon Blanc.. complete with a map!  Dinner was great and I'd go back.. just in my hometown and go somewhere a little more unique for Vegas next time."

Oddly I must say that the more memorable part of a very nice meal was the wheat toast that accompanied my breakfast eggs and bacon.  The toast was very thickly sliced from rustic bread.  It was off the charts good.  Service was excellent and the room was pleasant and sunlit on a sunny but chilly morning on the Strip."

  "text" : "We came here for dinner. I would give them 2-stars, but they gave us a comp cream puff with lit candle in place to celebrate our friend's birthday. So, that was really sweet of them. Also, their service rocked. So no 2-stars, instead 3-stars.\n\nTheir food is definitely let's-serve-\"french food\"-to-these-tourists sort of food. Although, they serve some fresh and warm french baguettes to start. (The comp bread is nicely paired with butter and pickled carrots. Yumsizzles.)\n\nThe steak that they're so well-known for are fillets... FILLETS. That means the meat isn't succulent and is rather how do you say.. super dry. Also they're really expensive at $25 or more a pop. My friend got the steak with bernaise sauce ($25).\n\nThe french onion soup was passable. I can make better. It was on the salty side. ($9)\n\nThe scallops with butternut squash and brussel sprouts were imbalanced, both far too sweet and far too bitter. They were supposed to complement each other, but in my opinion, just didn't work.\n\nThe french fries here are ninja-cut crazy fries, more like a hybrid between a chip and a fry. They're thin, messy, and far too crispy. You may like it, but I did not enjoy them since I was expecting french fries. They are paired with each steak course.\n\nAll in all, pretty mediocre food for the price tag. I'd head elsewhere. After all Vegas is a mecca of good eats."

We were escorted to a table for four, which I liked, it was much more roomy. Before ordering, you're given a complimentary baguette. I personally don't like baguettes, but I did love how soft the bread was on the inside and it's scrumptious with their lightly salted butter! So we ordered a Medium Hamburger with an Egg (eggs are optional, you can ask for it) at $12.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=WY4lwdmOoHEz3kqNbTy5Mg, a Medium Rare Prime Steak Sandwich at $14.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=kuQ8Vgt4HGeAOTzQQMtcUA, and finally a bowl of Four Mushroom Soup at $7.00/bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=n2rWGJfLS5zXk-E9-3oDHg. The soup was amazing, it starts off with a chunks of cut mushrooms at bottom, then the soup poured over it from a kettle of sorts. The soup itself was creamy and thick, loved the texture- it kind of warmed you to your toes in this weather. Then the mushrooms gives of their distinct flavor, it wasn't overpowering so the two went well together. The hamburger: it was huge. The one problem I had with it was that I had a very difficult time eating it. But it was delicious nonetheless! I loved the fact that they made the egg the way I liked it without even asking. It's cooked on the outside with the yolk runny on the inside. I advise to slurp all the yolk before putting the second half of the hamburger on or else you risk having soggy bread for the rest of the meal. The meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor, a definite treat for my taste buds! They also come with these extra crispy fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ulCtrY7QWobYjGjrS2OesQ in those cool cone containers. I would recommend this (w/ the egg!) if you're looking for something more familiar to your taste. :D\n\nSERVICE: Impeccable. We had a waiter and an assistant waiter, so we were taken care of whenever we needed it. Our waters were always full and they checked up on us around every 40 or so minutes and both of them were very friendly people, I can't recall our main waiters name, but I remember our assistant waiter was named Stephani... Lovely young lady.\n\nAMBIANCE: Very fancy, walls are dark red wood laced with wine bottles with dim lighting to give that lustrous, private feeling so it's dark on the inside. The tables are set with those multiple forks and knives along with wine glasses. Tables are also set with paper tops for easy cleaning. They even have a causal dress code of no sleeveless shirts for men, most of the people that were there seemed almost well dressed, collared polo and khakis, women in nice dress shirts. But it's not mandatory, I think it's the atmosphere.\n\nGotta check this place out if any of you are ever near Paris!"

You get a nice view of the Bellagio, Caesars, and The Cosmo and can people watch while you eat (in the non-creepy sense of the term). \n\nOur server was one of the best I've had while dining EVER. Demetrius was his name I believe. Real classy guy and had \"The Sense\" as I hope all servers do (\"The Sense\" - knowing when and how often to check in on a table). Very polite and seemed like a pro at his job. The food also came out quickly so that was impressive as well. \n\nI ordered the Turkey and Egg White Omelette which was delightful. Just the perfect amount of food for someone who is hungry but not looking to stuff his/her face till exploding. My gf kept it simple and just ordered the Three Egg dish and she enjoyed it. What was great about it was that the sausages were actual sausages. Not those dinky,  index finger-sized, shriveled sausages you normally get from a Denny's or Ihop. Prices aren't too bad either - pretty much average $11-18 a dish. \n\nThis is a great place to come for breakfast or brunch. Highly recommended. Ask for Demetrius, he is great!"

My first time having snail so I had nothing to compare it to, and I tend to get hesitant about unusual/exotic foods...but bf said it was really good so we'll go with that.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Filet Mignon Merlot Steak, medium-well, came with their fries. It was AMAZING, cooked to perfection, full of flavor. I like my meat to be juicy and tender but not very red. At a lot of places, if you request your meat to be well done, the meat comes out to dry, and if you want it juicy, you have to go with medium or rare. But this place did an amazing job at making it perfect - cooked well enough for my taste but still juicy and FLAVORFUL. Bf had the Steak Bordelaise, which he was very happy with as well.\n\nGreat experience, will definitely be back when in Vegas again!"

The only reason i'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the Beef Bourgogne I was served.  The fresh baguette with fennel slaw was very very tasty, as were the escargot and French onion soup.  I originally ordered the braised short rib special, offered that night, but I was later told it was sold out which was hugely disappointing, especially considering it was only 7:30pm or so.  Anyway, I went with the Beef Bourgogne since it was listed as a restaurant \"classic\" on the menu, hoping my braised meat craving would be satisfied.  Unfortunately the Beef Bourgogne came to my table looking like hot dog food over egg noodles.  It was just a big plate of mush, really.  We were on our way to a show, or I would have asked to send it back.  Plus, honestly, I was pretty satisfied with the starters I'd already eaten, so it wasn't like I was starving by then.  \n\nAll in all, I would go there again in a heartbeat; I just would never order the Beef Bourgogne if I could avoid it.  My husband and the rest of the family got steaks that all tasted amazing.

I'm a Fan (4 stars) - Simply orange juice.  Perfect because it is packed with vitamin C, but also very tasty start for the morning.  The orange juice was served in a flute glass.  The orange juice was not overtly sweet and nicely chilled--yet a bit flat.\n\nThree Eggs ($9.95) - A-Okay (4 Stars) - 3 eggs with your choice of crispy bacon or sausage.  All egg dishes are served with breakfast potatoes (aka hash browns) and toast.  Let me give you the breakfast entree breakdown:\n\n*3 eggs - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked--scrambled or sunny side up.  I chose scrambled and they were cooked very nicely.  Mmm, tasted so good with ketchup.  I wanted to add some Tapatio (or any hot sauce), but I didn't think they had it and was a bit embarrassed to ask for it.\n\n*Sausage - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You have a choice of regular or chicken sausage.  I chose regular sausage--you get 2 elongated ones.  The sausages were approximately 6 inches in length and 0.7\" in diameter.  The skin were cooked to a beautiful toasty brown color.  The sausage was nothing more than porky heavenly goodness.\n\n*Breakfast Potatoes - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Approximately 5\" x 5\" square area of hash browns.  The outer portion was cooked until nicely toasted--with a perfectly soft texture on the inside.  \n\n*Toast - Meh! I had better (2 Stars) - You get two pieces of thick toasted bread--3.5\" x 3\" x 1.5.\"  All I can really say is it felt like eating extra large croutons.\n\nThe Mon Ami Gabi staff seated us on the patio which is perfect because the weather was nice and we could people watch at the same time.  It is nice to finally relax with the family and have good food.  The food here is good, but was not extraordinary--hence my struggle.  I've rounded up so Yay! I'm a Fan!"

  "text" : "After reading about this place from Michelle T. and Carol L.'s reviews, I've decided to bookmarked this place to try when I'm back in Vegas.   I remember driving by this restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd. and  wondered if it was any good.  I made a reservation through open table for 10:30am. and asked for a patio seating.  My mom decided that it would be too cold to sit outside in a 57 degree weather so we decided to sit indoors right next to their patio seating area.  Even at this time, the restaurant was pretty much filled up.\n\nIt's a pretty long walk from the self parking lot at the Paris hotel to this restaurant.  We were getting lost trying to figure out where it was.  You have to pass all the shops and the casino lobby area to the very front of the hotel.  Don't wear heels.  The food here is definitely worth trying out for brunch/breakfast.  \n\nStrawberry waffles---5 stars!  Very crunchy made with buttermilk batter and topped with fresh strawberries.  Goes well with their warm maple syrup.  Very light and not heavy.  \n\nHam and Cheese omelette with gruyere cheese--4 stars.  My mom ordered this and she seemed to be happy with her dish.  Came with bread (5 stars) I just can't seem to remember the type of bread but it was delish!  The hash browns were flaky and excellent.\n\nCrepes- BF ordered this dish but we were both not too pleased with the texture and overall taste.  I'd skip on their crepes.  2 stars.\n\nFrench onion soup-  Yeah, it's $9 for a big cup of soup.  BUT, it's worth every sip!  We ended up fighting for the cheeeeeeeese!  Not too salt unlike other soups I've tried.  This is one soup I'd come back and order again!  Must order as an appetizer. Big enough to share with two people.  5+stars!\n\n\nCoffee--Very good coffee.   They are very good about offering refills whenever your cup is half way done.  5 stars\n\n\nService--Top notch!  5 stars!  Outstanding service from the minute you walk into the restaurant.   \n\nAmbience--LOVE it!  Wish they had a location in LA because I'd be a frequent customer!"

  "text" : "Whenever we're in Vegas, we have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi, our favorite restaurant in Vegas.  We were there for Thanksgiving dinner this year and had an outstanding turkey dinner. So, knowing that turkey was again on the menu and we would be in Vegas for Christmas, we happily made reservations at Mon Ami for 6:30 PM on Christmas Day.  \nWith reservations, the wait is minimal.  And, so it was this Christmas Day.  We were seated by a window overlooking the famed Bellagio Water Fountains.  We settled in for a romantic dinner.  The server, who (and I kid you not) was the spitting image of Flo from the Progressive car insurance commercials.  She flew by and said, \"We're out of turkey.\"  Huh?  How can you be out of turkey at 6:30 PM on Christmas Day? We had much a much later reservation on Thanksgiving and there was plenty of turkey then.  \nWhen the server returns, we tell her how disappointed we are about the turkey.  We were looking forward to their excellent turkey dinner for Christmas.  She didn't apologize. She shrugged and asked for our order.  We asked for a couple more minutes and it was obvious by the look she gave us that she wasn't happy with us.\nWe decided to have appetizers (oysters for me, salad for hubby) and split a steak with pommes frites.  After she took our order, we overheard another server telling his table about the evening's specials.  We then realized our server had never mentioned them to us.  \nWhen hubby saw the manager, Constantine, walking by, he asked him to stop by our table.  We shared how disappointed we were not to have turkey on Christmas.  He profusely apologized and told us we had every right to be upset. he had already received complaints about running out of turkey.  He said someone in the back had not ordered enough turkey for the weekend.  He wanted to make it up to us when the check came.  \nHubby had asked for a glass of ice when he ordered his wine.  When the server came back with the appetizers, he reminded her that he still didn't have his glass of ice.  She promised to bring him one as soon as possible.  As she walked past me, I heard her say, \"Christ!\"  Finally, halfway through dinner, the glass of ice came.\nAfter dinner, we asked the server to see the dessert menu.  I asked for coffee while we waited for the menu.  I got my coffee and we waited and waited.  Finally, she comes not with the menu but with our check.  When hubby reminded her that we wanted to have dessert, she said, \"You said you didn't want dessert, only coffee.\"  Not wanting to argue, we asked for the menu again.  By the time it came, I was ready to leave.  Dinner was a big disappointment.  \nConstantine, however, came through.  He gave us a 50% discount off our meal.  We thank you, Constantine.  You were a class act!  \nYes, we'll come back.  Their food is delicious and their location is perfect.  We're chalking the experience to an off night.  Every restaurant has one and unfortunately we were there for Mon Ami Gabi's."

The bread was delicious, the drinks were great, and the steak was gigantic, it could have really been split between two people. We sat on the inner patio and still had a great view of the Bellagio show. Service was good. And our waiter even spoke with a French accent (although I'm 98% sure it was fake to increase the ambiance)."

  "text" : "My girlfriend and I opted to dine here Christmas night, and are SO glad that we did. Talk about a wonderfully-appointed restaurant with a polite, professional staff to match. The food is absolute bliss in your mouth, and sitting on the patio, we were treated to a multi-billion dollar view. \n\nBeing that it was Christmas night, the restaurant was fairly busy, and so, even though I'd made reservations a week and a half early, we still ended up waiting about 20 minutes extra to be seated; no big deal - it happens. However, it would have been a different story had we needed to get to a show or something. \n\nWe were seated on the outside patio, which was very chilly, but under heat lamps, our table was very comfortable. The patio of Mon Ami is directly across from Bellagio, which gives you a tremendous view of the fountains - the classiest thing on the Strip. The way the buildings are situated, it's relatively easy to hear the soundtrack for the fountain show, which is really cool. \n\nOur server was really nice; attentive, very personable and professional. She was friendly and not overly chatty, and made us feel very welcome, even though the restaurant was packed. \n\nThe bread that is brought to the table is wonderful; fresh, warm and baked just right. The butter served isn't very soft, but it wasn't concrete either; what a yummy appetizer! They DO bring more bread if you'd like, so don't be shy. \n\nI had the Hanger Steak, which comes topped with a merlot butter and a mountain of Mon Ami's signature fries - \"frites\" - which were simply amazing to begin with, but when used to mop up the steak's juice and left-over butter... beautiful! The steak was prepared medium-rare and was a TAD on the chewy side; but that was the cut, not a ding toward the cooks. It was very tasty and absolutely filling.\n\nMy girlfriend had the Steak Classique, which came topped with maitre  d'hôtel butter as well as a mound of frites. Hers was also cooked medium-rare, and was perfect. In fact, the taste was so rich, she barely used any of the butter at all. \n\nI had a Blue Moon beer and she had a glass of Mon Ami's Frangria, which she adored. \n\nWe didn't have dessert because we thought that would come elsewhere (which it didn't - damn that booze and gambling). \n\nAll in all, the bill came to about $70 bucks for the dinner. For a great meal, I'd say between $70-150 should be expected at Mon Ami Gabi. However, with the amazing ambience, incredibly nice staff and outstanding food, it's a price gladly paid on a special occasion, and we WILL be back again. \n\nDefinitely wait to sit on the outside patio if you have the time; it's absolutely worth it. Pure magic!"

The steaks have been flattened by a bus so it's pretty much impossible to have it cooked any way but well done.  The noise level is ridiculous.  I was literally shivering eating dinner, it's so cold.  I guess they have to keep it so cold so they can cool down the outside seating area (and the rest of Las Vegas.)\nIn a word -- sucks."

My PIL got a little lost and so we were seated a tad late but at least they didn't give up our table! ^_^\n\nOur server Sarah was excellent and the bussers were great too.

They serve bread (freshly baked) and butter at each meal.\n\nI ordered a salmon and was EXTREMELY please. Most places over-cook fish and I'm a stickler for properly cooked fish. I'm constantly yelling at my husband, \"Don't over-cook the fish!\" In fact, I'm surprised I ordered the fish, considering how often I have been disappointed by restaurants in the past. Mon Ami did not disappoint!\n\nOverall... very happy with this restaurant. I read some past YELP reviews and noticed the \"understaffed\" comments. All I have to say is that it's really difficult for restaurants to staff appropriately for rushes. We, however, were there during a \"non-rush\" time and were extremely flattered by the attentiveness of the staff. \n\nGood Job!"

  "text" : "My Friend, Gabi! 4.5 stars for you! How wonderful & tasty you are! I reallllllyyyy wanted to give you a 5-star but my friends felt that a 4-star was more just. I am so excited that my friends and I decided to go eat steak in Vegas instead of the usual buffet. My sister was the first to recommend me to try Mon Ami Gabi and although I was hesistant, I decided to go. And man, I definitely do not regret my experience at Mon Ami Gabi!\n\nLet's start with the atmosphere and service. The atmosphere is definitely a romantic one, and one where you're facing the Ceasar's Palace fountain. The view is amazing and even though we were sitting inside, it was still a nice atmosphere. As for the service, I thought our waitress did a really great job with us. There were 10 of us, which you can imagine how annoying it can be, and yet she was very friendly and very patient with us. Our waitress made great recommendations for us, she constantly checked up on us, and she was very patient and nice about splitting up the bills for us.\n\nNow, let's get to the drinks, entree, and dessert. Here's everything I had and tried: Fangria (drink), Filet Mignon with merlot butter (entree), Creme Brulee (dessert), and White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Ice Cream (dessert). \n\nFangria: If you've ever had gluhwein (mulled wine), this was like the best gluhwein you'll ever had. It's almost like a chilled gluhwein with just a hint of rosemary. It was a perfect beginning to our New Year's Night.\n\nFilet Mignon with Merlot Butter: I had mine cooked to medium rare and I loved that the chef cooked it just the way I like it. There weren't any blood dripping down my plate but the inside of the steak was a bit reddish pink. Not just that, but the filet was cooked so tender with the surface a bit glazed. Also, the merlot butter is BY FAR the best sauce I've ever had with filet. It's probably the best pairing with steak and now, I know how I like my steak to taste like! \n\nFrites: This came as a side with my filet mignon. I can see why some people may not like their fries but it was my favorite! I'd say Mon Ami Gabi's fries comes as 2nd best fries I've ever had (after Michael Symon's Bspot's Lola Fries). These fries are really thin and really crispy. If you usually like those big fries with lots of potato or sweet potato in it, then this isn't for you. These are really thinly sliced fries with just the right amount of crunch.\n\nCreme Brulee: SOOOOOO GOOD! I don't think I've ever had terrible creme brulee and Mon Ami Gabi's definitely didn't disappoint either. However, I think the creme brulee could've have used a little more vanilla bean extract.\n\nBread Pudding: meh. if anything, this might be the reason I lowered a star for mon ami gabi. The bread pudding was great, it just wasn't the best i've ever had. \n\nOverall, I loved this restaurant. I think it's a must try if you want to have great reasonable pricing steak and still end up with a great deal! My bill at the end came up roughly $50 (including tax and gratuity). \n\nMon Ami Gabi! Thanks for a great New Year's Eve dinner."

Sooooooo charming and attended to every little detail. The amuse bouche that came with the bread was an addictive little slaw of grated beets, fennel and a peppery vinaigrette.

Why would you give us the option after we were standing in line for so long, it should have just been a check in point.

As soon as the next table over sat down I was so squished, no place to put my purse and his backpack, not comfortable at all. The lighting was horrible, one minute it would be super bright from the sun outside and the next super dark with the cloud cover and dim indoor lighting.

  "text" : "How do people view French food?  \"Bread and wine\", \"Snails\", and \"I don't know, all I know are French Fries\" are the popular answers in America, but after you try this place out there is no other answer but delicious.  We have eaten the escargot, the French onion soup, the Filet Mignon, the Sirloin, and drank some wine.  \n\nLet me start with the appetizers.  The escargot and the French onion soup was delightful.  It was my first time trying the escargot, and it was sublime!  There is a sort of cheesy texture to it; not what I had expected, but it was very good.  The French onion soup was the best I have ever had.  Most French onion soups are (in one word) salty.  Very little salt taste in this one, but the cheese inside this soup makes up for the absence sodium.  Very creative and very good.  If you have not tried their escargot or French onion soup, I suggest you try these two when trying this restaurant.\n\nThe bread and butter that came with the meal was great.  Real French style bread and the butter which melted on the bread upon contact was wonderful.  Their wine selection was adequate.  I had myself a Bordeaux and the misses had a Nutty Russian.  The wine was a great compliment to the bread and butter and later the steaks, but the Nutty Russian had too much alcohol for a mixed drink to my taste.  \n\nNow the main dishes: the steaks!  Let me start by saying the Filet Mignon here is now my personal standard for all Filet Mignons.  The beef steak cut literally like butter!  I had ordered it medium rare (how steak should be eaten).  The moment I bit into a piece of that steak, my mouth was filled with an over joyous sensation that can not be put into words.  You just have to try it for yourself.  The misses' Sirloin was good, but it was nothing compared to my steak.  \n\nThe service here is great.  The waitress made us feel as if we were good friends.  Great conversation, did not feel rushed, and made our experience all the better.  The food came out on time, and when something was late like our appetizers, she explained why in full detail; without us asking.  This shows punctuality on her part.  \n\nThis is definitely one place I am coming back to eat in when I am in Vegas again.  Not just being the best French restaurant, but let's name this place a great steakhouse too, if not just for it's Filet Mignon.  Cheers everyone and happy yelping!!"

Don't bother with their seafood options (I've been spoiled by the seafood in SF and Seattle, so I'm pickier than most) and dessert menu. This is an amazing place to take a date or your significant other because right across the street is the fountain show at the Bellagio that occurs about every half hour."

  "text" : "I enjoyed myself so much at this restaurant, I went there for 3 meals (2 dinners and 1 lunch) during my 4 day-3 night stay. The bartenders, waiters, waitresses, and the random workers filling my water glass and bringing my bread were lovely people! The hostess not so much.\n\nThe food was kind of hit or miss- I loved the steak and frites (au poivres and bordelaise), the salmon (I'm not a fish fan, but it came on a lovely bed of mashed potatoes, pearl onions, and roasted garlic), champagne, and belvedere martini (alcohol is food, sure). \n\nI was not so fond of- banana fosters crepe (the crepe was a little rubbery, bananas were raw, and it was all covered in melted brown sugar, altogether it could have been much, much better), fish and frites (the pan fried fish lacked seasoning, and it had a weird texture), creme brulee (it had too much burnt taste).\n\nThe reason why I give it four stars, is because when you're sitting on the patio sipping champagne, watching the ridiculous tourists do their ridiculous tourists things, with the Bellagio fountain dancing serenely to Con Te Partiro across the street, you can't help but love your life. Well, my life. I had a lovely experience, and oftentimes in Vegas, that is what you pay for- the experience."

  "text" : "Best filet mignon I've ever had! And I live in LA where I've tried plenty of filet mignon dishes at numerous fancy restaurants. I went to Vegas twice in a two week period, and came back to Mon Ami Gabi on my second visit. I wondered if the filet I had on my first trip was a fluke, but I ordered it again and it lived up to its high expectations. I order the filet mignon with the roquefort butter - it's a must try!! They serve it with some sort of vegetable, or you can choose fries I believe. \n\nThe service at Mon Ami is excellent. The servers are courteous and prompt, and if you stop to look around you can see everyone working really hard. I also tried Mon Ami for brunch. I tried the crepe with fruit, it wasn't as amazing as the dinner I had there but it was still good. For brunch we sat on the patio which I definitely recommend. It's great for people watching and to see the Bellagio fountain show of course! For dinner they will bring out a little baguette with butter before your meal. It's warm and delicious! \n\nThe prices are as expected for a nice restaurant. It's not cheap. It's not ridiculous. The bottom line is that it's GREAT food on the Vegas strip, which is sometimes really hard to find. The only thing that can be tough about this place is the wait time. If you want to go there call and make a reservation! There are always people waiting no matter what time you go. I really love this restaurant, I wish they had one in LA. I'm still daydreaming about my filet mignon."

  "text" : "Went there with my wife this last Thanksgiving.   We had a \"date night\"  without kids so we decided to try out this place -- mainly because of the positive YELP reviews, as well as the great location.  If you sit outside, there is a great view of the Bellagio outdoor water show.   Our view was blocked at times, however, by those advertisement trucks that pollute the Vegas Strip.  They have heat lamps so it is still pretty warm even once the sun sets.  We ordered the filet mignon (pretty good here) with the roquefort butter.  The ambience was perfect for a romantic dinner.  We didn't feel rushed by our waittress and she was very nice, checking on us from time to time without being too intrusive.  We usually don't take longer than an hour or hour and half for dinner when it's just the two of us, but because it was so relaxing we stayed for close to two hours!   Wouldn't recommend this place for those with kids but overall had a great experience!  Next time we are in Vegas, we'll definitely drop by again!  \n\nBy the way, make sure you make reservations before you go as it gets crowded.  You can make reservations online too I believe."

The dark ambiance was extremely beautiful and the place is huge, so lots of seating. We got the best seat in the house, right in the center of the patio. We had to wait a little while for our seat, so my friends and I got free drinks just because we had to wait (so nice of them!). There were heaters outside so we were very comfortable. It was a cold night after all. We tried the escargo and mussels. Both were delicious, though I preferred the mussels because I just love seafood. I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was out of this world delicious. The mashed potatoes were so smooth they melted in my mouth. Don't know how they got them so smooth. The salmon was unbelievable, and so were the  mushrooms. My friends got steak and it was very thin and cooked exactly how they asked. They couldn't stop raving about it. The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the location and ambience were PERFECT. I can't wait to go back."

  "text" : "Ahh, this is why I live in Vegas:  to be able to visit Paris, New York, and Venice, all without a single TSA body-cavity search!\n\nWe had tickets for Anthony Cools at the Paris, and a $30 coupon for Mon Ami Gabi, courtesy of - -  I have no idea why it came in the mail.  I'd been wanting to try it for a long time, so it was the perfect opportunity to sample the restaurant on the cheap.\n\nI called for reservations at around 6 pm, and when I was told their first available was at 9:15, we decided to take our chances with the line.  We got beepers for both the patio and inside, and the 45 minute to one hour wait turned out to be pretty accurate.  The patio beckoned first, and I sure was happy about that!  No matter how many times I see the Bellagio water show, it never ceases to delight me.  And though it was a chilly night, all the propane heaters blasting away kept my left side warm enough to remove my jacket.\n\nI ordered a glass of rosé, and it was great that the waiter brought out a bottle and poured a taste for me.  I hated the rosé, since I'm not a fan of dry.  So much better than having a bartender do the pour, and then have to send the whole glass back or tough it out.  The waiter asked what kind of wine I like, and came back with a fresh glass and a bottle of Vouvray.  That wine was perfection!\n\nHubby and I shared a hanger steak and a salmon/spinach salad.  I ordered the steak medium rare; he likes his steak cooked to the consistency of shoe leather, so I knew he'd be sending his half back.  Turned out he had to:  the steak was still mooing.  It was on the live side of rare, but it was so delicious that I forged ahead.  He sent his back to be cooked medium, and it came back the way it was originally ordered, i.e., medium rare.   In an attempt at health-consciousness, we had asked if we could substitute the garlic spinach for the frites, and the answer was \"yes, for a two-dollar upcharge.\"  The spinach was so good we were happy we'd done that.  But when hubby's steak was returned, it was garnished with that big portion of frites that we'd spurned.  There went the New Year's Resolution, and they stayed crispy down to the last one.\n\nThe salmon was a rather thin portion, and a bit OVERcooked.  Though many people don't prefer it, a really good restaurant will undercook salmon.  But the flavor was delicious, and the citrusy dressing on the spinach was delicate and not drowning the dish.\n\nThough the food wasn't cooked to the highest standard, it was terrific, nonetheless.  Add a great baguette, wonderful service devoid of any hauteur (our waiter was Mexican), a fabulous glass of wine, and a sublime, even romantic ambiance, and you have the reasons for my five stars."

  "text" : "I came to celebrate my friends birthday here with Norma Jean O. To really experience this place you HAVE TO SIT ON THE PATIO. It just brings a certain ambiance to it, and I can't deny, if they replaced our eccentric tourists with more sofisticated strollers, I'd be as close to the look and feel Paris as I can get. The view is worth the seating and price, and it really sets the mood for something intimate or toned down. Definitely an atmosphere to easily strike conversation.\n\nI had the All Natural Chicken Breast with Frittes. It was a great dish, but the only thing I was really dissappointed about was the fact that the dish was nothing special. Nothing that makes Mon Ami's chicken breast different from any other joint that serves chicken breast. I'd expect a 5 star quality chicken experience for the price you pay for. The chicken was very tender, and it is a big portion of chicken so that made me feel a bit more satisfied. I watched my friends eat the escargot for appertizer. Honestly, it smelled delicous and sounded delicous, but my heart wasn't ready to try it so I passed on that one. But, if you have a strong stomach and heart, and have the courage to try it, I WOULD suggest to try it. I heard its amazing.\n\nWe pretty much knocked down a bunch of desserts in the end, but what I loved and remembered was the banana bread with ice cream. Soft and delicous, and it had that light crunch due to the walnuts. Yay!"

  "text" : "So I only had dinner here, can't say anything about what lunch is like.  For dinner I ordered the french onion soup, the beef bourguignon, and the apple tarte tatin.  I was amazed at how quickly the soup came out, within probably 5 minutes of placing our order, and was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't really hot.  I didn't even need to let it cool off, and the cheese, while melty, was only ok.  What I did not like was how few onions there were in the bowl, there were more croutons in the bowl than onions I felt like.  The broth however was tasty and well spiced which was nice.\n\nThe beef bourguignon was perfectly adequate, nothing special, nothing bad.  I might be spoiled in that my grandmother makes this dish and makes it really well and I've also had it while traveling in France.\n\nThe apple tarte at the end though was horrid though, and we sent it back after a few bites.  It looked and tasted as if they had used dried apples for it, like the ones you would get out of a bag at the market.  Not only that, but it had a waxy texture and was cloyingly sweet.  All in all, a very bad end to the meal.  Not only that, but I ordered a cafe nuit with desert, and they were unable to make it because they ran out of Calvados, a French apple brandy.  How the heck does a French restaurant, especially one on the strip, run out of this, especially during CES?!\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed with the meal, especially because of all the good reviews I had read on here as well as the favorable word of mouth I had heard."

We got to see the show every 20 minutes as we sat on the outside patio under some heat lamps.\n\nWe got a steak and a pear salad, and it was decent but quite pricey. For example, the salad was slightly over $10 and for that price I would've expected a large salad that could actually serve as a meal. Instead, it was more like a side dish. I think some mention large portions, but this is not true at all. The steak dish did come on a large plate, but 75% of the dish was filled with frites, a ton of tiny little thin cut and crispy fries. Not really my favorite kind, especially in that quantity.\n\nThis is a fancy yet affordable place for business meetings and group get-togethers, but make sure you get a reservation if coming during a busy season like CES. There is also still a line for reservations, but it's much better than waiting in the non-reservation line.\n\nI probably wouldn't come here again as I could just watch the fountain show for free and with an even better view, and the food is not worth returning for."

Entertaining to watch...sure, but I think I would have enjoyed the fountains a bit more (and this review would have gotten an extra star).\n\nFor this price, I expected huge quality of food that would last me for the next meal or two. I figured a tuna tar tar salad would hit an empty stomach pretty nicely. My eyes were let down when a tiny bowl of greens and four slices of tuna came out.

She brought out a few wine for us to sample before we make our decision on a glass (this is Vegas, who does that?).\n\nTheir French onion soup is the best I have tasted so far and it is a must order item if you like onion soup. The savory onion flavor shines through the hot ungreasy broth with the perfect amount of cheese on top. Bravo!!\n\nHanger steak was cooked exactly medium rare without tasting cold in the center. $20 for this steak is a wonderful deal. \n\nchocolate mousse was so good. It certainly was freshly whipped (along with a side of housemade whipped cream) and the sweetness was just right. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. With the bellagio fountain being across the street, this is worth flying to Vegas for!!!"

My chicken was dry and lacked any sort of spices or seasoning and my frites were cold. I wonder how long it all sat under the 'warmer' in the back.... my companions' dishes fared the same. Steak cooked not to order, simple fish and chips soggy and cold and mushroom soup that despite having mushrooms dotting the creamy base, overall tasted nothing like mushrooms - more like cream.\n\nAnd CHRIST - can the waterboyman please NOT slosh the water and 500 cubes of ice across our entire table? \n\nIf our clients were more business and less friendly, I would have been embarrassed by this choice in restaurant. Luckily, I'll never have to worry about that again because I will never come back to Mon Ami Chain Restaurant Gabi."

Why not?\n\nWe started at the \"Make your own Bloody Mary Bar\".  Funny how our outings usually begin and end at a bar, but I digress...   For 10 bucks you choose your vodka, they bring a generous pour in a tall glass and over to the \"bar\" you go.  There are mixers both spicy and mild, olives of all kinds, celery, beef sticks, pickled veggies, and horseradish to name a few options.  Don't like your drink, blame the bartender...\n\nFor breakfast we had Slow Roasted Beef Eggs Benedict, loved the creamy Hollandaise sauce over the braised short ribs.  Classic Quiche Lorraine with bacon cheese and onions.  Corned beef hash with poached eggs and a roasted red pepper sauce completed our meal,  We all enjoyed the entrees, but liked the Bloody Marys more.\n\nAll in all a good breakfast.  We arrived just in time and got to sit on the patio by the windows.  Pretty funny watching the stragglers from the night before head back to their hotels early in the morning...  The view was priceless and made us remember days gone by.  Au Revior, Mes Amis!...thanks for sharing your Birthday weekend, it was a blast!"

  "text" : "For me - Vegas is an experience for all the senses. By balancing tasty eats, a show or two, some cocktails, shopping and slots, I feel I walk away having a complete and lovely experience. It's about exploring, while keeping splurges in check and minding some sort of budget. I'm always on the lookout for new culinary delights.\n\nThat said, 5 years ago during my first trip to Vegas, my family set out to multiple steakhouses to find the perfectly aged, and scrumptious steak. We went everywhere. My pops spent some silly money, but wasn't blown away yet. On a lark, near the end, we tried Mon Ami Gabi. The filet mignon and escargot...and I kid you not...we were still telling people about it 5 years later! So, naturally, I was a bit nervous to return as I had relived the ecstasy in that meal over and over in my head and was fearful a second return trip would not deliver in the same fashion.\n\nThankfully, it did!\n\nThe filet mignon once again, melted in my mouth. The meat had a wonderful sear on the outside and was cooked perfectly to my preferred medium to medium rare temp. We had made reservations, so our seat for two at the windows was picturesque. It was sunset and following a renewal of our vows. Watching the fountains and the sky change colors was incredibly romantic. I could tell my hubby was a little envious of my filet mignon, he opted to save $10 and go with a cheaper cut (what a sweetie) so I made sure to give him plenty of bites. The mashed potatoes were the perfect compliment to my meat. My hubby went for the sweet potato mash which wasn't the best combo with his blue cheese topping, but it wasn't a disaster in any sense. He still really enjoyed his steak and the flavors (just didn't do much of his sweet mash with it). \n\nOur service was good and her assistant (who cleared and refilled) was very attentive and kind. Our server also brought us a mini dessert free of charge in honor of our wedding renewal. It was divinely sweet (and we definitely tipped her more for the gesture).\n\nWe'll definitely be returning in the future. Yum.\n\nPROS\nViews!\nFilet Mignon (If memory serves, I may have licked the plate when no one was looking)\nLocation - Central on strip\nPrice - Very reasonable when compared to other \"steak\" orientated establishments. Steaks are in 20s and 30s. Bargain in Vegas.\n\nCONS\nChain (I think? I love supporting non-chain when possible)\nTwo of my escargots were gritty"

Sitting outside would have yielded a better view, but we were definitely too hungry to wait.\n\nI had the Steak Bordelaise while my boyfriend had the Steak Classique. Service was friendly and could have been a little faster but I didn't mind since I was still in recovery mode. The French bread came out nice and warm and had the perfect crust. Steaks were good and I enjoyed the red wine sauce of the bordelaise, but the caramelized onions were a bit too sweet for me. The frites were a nice accompaniment since it wasn't has heavy and greasy as American style fries. Makes eating meat and potatoes a lot more lady like and sophisticated rather than a big hunk of pink meat.\n\nOverall, a decent place to grab some French style eats, but being in Vegas, there's probably better deals at the multitude of buffets; total bill came out to be $80ish with tip for the two steak entrees and four orange juices (boo on not having free refills!)"

We also ordered the Country Style Pate and although it was still morning, they were very accommodating and were able to prepare the dish for us.  It could have been more to room temperature but nevertheless it was delicious over the country toast slathered with mustard.  The cornichons and pickled pearl onions added to the dish as it cut the fatty richness of the pate.\n\nGood service, good environment and would definitely like to try the other dishes, but so many more restaurants to visit and my stomach ain't that big."

The fiance and I shared one and it was so good we both wished there would be more! \n\nThe bread they serve is also piping hot and fresh. Delicious just with butter!\n\nThe steaks here are all good-- I think having your steak medium or medium rare would give you the best texture. The four of us all ordered a different steak, and I had the chance to try them all- they were all delicious, I don't think you can go wrong-- it just depends on the sauce, if you prefer savory or more sweet.\n\nGreat restaurant, with a great view of the Bellagio Water show..what's not to love?!"

  "text" : "Many people recommended Mon Ami Gabi to me for some time.  I decided to give this place a whirl and have dinner for my friend's birthday here.\n\nI made reservations for our party of 4 for a Sunday night at 6:30pm on opentable.com.  Outdoor patio seating which has a view of the Bellagio water show is available but I believe it's on a first come, first serve basis.  We were lucky enough to get an inside table that had that view.  Note: they will not seat you until your entire party is present.  \n\nThe steaks were usually recommended to me.  I decided to order steak classique ($24.95).  I wanted a smaller piece of steak and our waitress made these steaks sound appealing saying that they were pounded down to about half an inch thick and would be extremely tender.  I ordered it medium rare, but it was more along the lines of medium well which had very little pinkness to it.  It was a bit tough and wasn't flavorful as I expected.  I had a bite of my friend's filet and that was delicious.  If I would've gotten that, Mon Ami would've received another star from me.  The accompanied fries were DELICIOUS.  The fries were cut thin and deep fried until crispy and very few soft pieces remained.\n\nAs an appetizer, we ordered the Escargot de Bourgogne ($10.95) which was yummy.  Six pieces of escargot was marinated in a garlic herb butter sauce which also made great dipping sauce for the bread.\n\nOur waitress was nice but the servers were usually the ones that were more helpful.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday.  They brought him a small dessert with a candle (he didn't like us singing happy birthday lol).\n\nKeep in mind, dinner is long and there is a lot of wait time between dishes.  I believe our dinner took more than two hours therefore don't dine here if you're crunched on time.\n\nP.S. Think twice if you're ordering a drink. My friend ordered a Hennessy & 7up which he though was a bit watered down.  Turns out the drink was $21."

  "text" : "I regret to inform you I will never recommend your eatery to anyone. For months we had been planning our daughter 21st birthday celebration we chose to have her \"birthday Dinner\" at Mon Ami Gabi Las Vegas last Saturday (making our reservations weeks ago). Our table was not ready when we arrived and we were asked to stand at the bar are where there was very little room. The table they placed our party of 8 at was obviously only meant for 6. From the moment our server arrived at out table his attitude was deplorable. He was very impatient with questions we had regarding the menu. We eventually asked for bread and an assistant of his brought some out to us. As we ordered he became more impatient with our table. He acted as if we were a bother him. It was obvious we were celebrating as our daughter had a birthday crown and sash on. Not once did he act like our dinner was anything special (only an annoyance to him). He seemed very disgusted in the fact the two entrees wer e going to be shared. While ordering wine he was quick to point out I was uneducated in French wines. We where all from the Napa Valley and very familiar with the products in our region (I am not from France). We were not allowed to bring the sparkling or still wine we travelled with for our dinner. Forced to order off your wine list and having questions he left me feeling stupid...When our tables soup arrived cold (not delivered by him, nor did he come to see if it was ok) I was able to call someone over to have the soup go back. Our waiter did learn of the cold soup and discussed in front of our table with his co-workers. He stated that we were not the 1st table to get cold soup that night. Again he showed his disgust in front of our \"party\". Our entrees arrived (not all at once). While the meal was tasty the server completely ruined the meal for me and my 7 guests including our birthday girl. The \"complimentary dessert\" that was brought to our daughter was lack lu ster after our treatment at dinner. I would NEVER have left him 18% tip however I complied with the bill. Not wanting to take any more away from our \"special evening\" I chose to contact you upon our return home. Our $330 dinner will not be long forgotten; however it will be because of the bad taste it left with all of us. The \"fine dinning\" we had been promised did not exist. \nWrote above to them directly. Got a response that they would like for us to try them again...like I go to Vegas every week..NOT!"

That's exactly what the Hubs and I did this past week thanks to all the amazing reviews for this spot at Paris Las Vegas.\n\nSince we were staying at Paris, it was easy to make a lunch reservation and wonder downstairs to partake in some good food.  We asked to sit outside, which was accommodated.  It was cold and windy out, but the heaters were on and it was worth it to be able to people watch and enjoy the sunshine.  The atmosphere alone is reason enough to come to this restaurant, but when you add on fantastic food, your have a sure bet (please don't mind the Vegas pun- LOL).  \n\nSo, as far as the food is considered... we shared the baked brie, french onion soup, and the croque monsieur.  Though this was a cheese filled meal, it was SOOO... good!  The baked brie was absolutely to die for.  It was served with toasted/salt and peppered bread, honey, roasted garlic, and toasted hazelnuts.  WOW- I just started salivating thinking about it again.... the french onion soup was also great, but maybe a bit TOO much cheese (if there is such a thing).  The sandwich was awesome paired with crispy fries.  Simple, but done well.  Oh, the bread, a whole baguette, was warm and gone in 5 minutes.\n\nHaving stayed at Paris before, I am disappointed I never ate here previously.  I can't say that mistake will ever happen again because I will surely eat here every time I am in Vegas- that's a promise!"

I expected that would set us back at least 30 minutes, considering it was a holiday. Instead, we were immediately seated and continued to have a great time. My hangar steak was outstanding, but the star was my wife's duck (a special for the evening) was out this world! Probably the best duck I've ever had!\n\nOur experience was so good, I wanted to go the next evening. We will plan to hit Mon Ami Gabi every trip from now on."

Surprisingly we got in to Mon Ami Gabi with zero wait.  OUr waitress was nice and informative.   Everything came out really fast.  I had a steak and my wife got the short rib special.  Both were outstanding.  I didn't care for the fries, they were more like frenches potato straws or something like that so I would avoid those and get a different side next time but as someone that has to travel to Vegas often for business there will definitely be a next time."

Last night, before we went to see Jubilee, we had dinner at MAG.  I love the atrium room in the evening.  The lights are low, but not so low that you can't see anything.  And having the B Fountains as a backdrop is perfect. \n\nService at MAG is top notch, very attentive without being intrusive.  I love to sit in Server #100's section - he's great, kinda reminds me of Chef Robert Ivrine.\n\nAnyway, this time the order was:\n\nSteak Bordelaise:  The steak was cooked to perfection topped with carmelized onions in a red wine sauce.  Oh yeah.\nMAG Caesar Salad:  Just the right amount of dressing, fresh romaine and shavings of pecorino cheese.\nTrout Almondine:  Seared to succulent goodness with just a crispness around the edges, covered with green beans.\nTo start there was a celery, green apple slaw tossed in olive oil and the baguette with butter.\n\nWhat a wonderful meal, what a wonderful atmosphere in a wonderful city.\n\nThanks, MAG!"

  "text" : "Is Mon Ami Gabi all about the food or the view?\nBefore dining here I read the many reviews my friends wrote on Mon Ami and half talked about the food and half talked about the cool view of the strip and the people watching. Well, I'm happy to report that Mon Ami Gabi is great for both. \n\nLocated at the Paris hotel, Mon Ami Gabi is a super popular joint because its huge outdoor patio sits right on the strip, with an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains. No matter what time of day you visit Mon Ami the patio is jammed pack full of people. \n\nMon is a good spot to visit for any meal. Whether you want breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner you're bound to find something tasty. \nMy wife and I ate breakfast here on our most recent trip to LV. I made reservations through Opentable.com and when we arrived we were sat on the patio within mere moments. After looking over the large menu and hearing their daily specials, this is what we ordered;\n\nMe- Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict W/ caramelized onions, hollandaise sauce and hashbrowns http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=hXY6rJfbWKAbfpXatsJ-7g\nMy Wife- Strawberry Waffle W/ fresh whipped cream and a side of sausage http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Oym0dA3Z42jtulQx3f_BWQ \n\nMy Benedict was amazing. The meat was super tender and flavorful and both the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce were perfect. I also really enjoyed their housemade English muffins. My wife's waffle was light and crispy and had a warm, fluffy middle. The strawberries that were on top of her waffle were extremely fresh and sweet. The side sausage was good too. To drink we both had a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ, which was super refreshing.\n\nThe prices here are really reasonable and our server was super friendly and helpful. \n\nMy favorite part of breakfast though was by far the people watching. Even though it was early, the strip was littered with people who were staggering back to their hotel rooms after a long night of hard partying. And since it was such a cool, beautiful day in Vegas we took our times eating and had a wonderful time watching the entertaining crowd. Next time I want to dine here at night and watch the Bellagio fountain show. \nCheck out Mon Ami Gabi for yourself. I know you'll love it."

  "text" : "For an early breakfast on the Strip that is nice, and located in the good part of town where you wont be bothered by drunk tools drinking their huge gold bottles of red bull and vodka, you cant do better than this very nice french style bistro located in Paris. \n\nThe prices for all brunch items are under 14 bucks, which is a real good deal for this caliber restaurant right on the Strip. Wont go into the food, because hundreds have already spilled the beans on them. I will just say that you have to request the outside patio section, and do the people watching. You are on an elevated platform, so the people shuffling by can't always hear you making fun of them. And even if they do, there is a partition separating you from the sidewalk so unless they are parkour champions, you will be safe to stare and laugh away."

  "text" : "On a recommendation of a friend, and good reviews on Yelp, I decided we had to check this place out. Weeks in advance, I set a reservation through Open Table for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. \n\nDress code here is mostly lenient--no sleeveless shirts for the gentlemen and no swimwear for the ladies--chances aren't likely that you'll run into anyone from the Jersey Shore here. \n\nBut it is a popular place. There are two lines at the entrance. We arrived a few minutes early but stood in line anyway because it looked like it would be several minutes of waiting. And it was.  One line was for those with reservations and one line was for those without. I overheard someone in the \"without reservations\" line say there would be an hour wait for a table outside. When we got to the front, we let them know our name and reservation time and were seated immediately at a little table for two inside but facing the Fountains of Bellagio. \n\nWe were brought a loaf of delicious fresh, warm bread and split an order of escargot de Bourgogne for $11. My husband says the bread was probably the best he'd ever had and we cleaned the escargot dish to save the dishwasher some extra work.  \n\nMy husband ordered the trout amandine, a recommendation of the hostess that seated us.  It was a huge filet of trout prepared with a lemony dressing--light and healthy but full of flavor and a large enough serving for even my hungrier half to be content. \n\nI had the filet mignon with the merlot butter. It was prepared beautifully...exactly as I ordered and just the perfect flavor. \n\nBased on the food alone, we would absolutely return to Mon Ami Gabi.  Everything was delicious and our dinner was so reasonably priced, we were a bit surprised--$76 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert in a restaurant with a view on the strip. Say what?! \n\nIt's a bit noisy in there but that seems to be par for the course in Vegas. We keep trying to find nice romantic restaurants and it seems the party environment that Vegas is doesn't seem to allow for it...knowing that in advance, I'd still return to Mon Ami Gabi again."

The staff was friendly & very accommodating.  We asked to have the outdoor heaters over our table turned off when we first arrived.  We had just walked down the strip from the MGM & wanted to cool off a little bit.  Then, when we got chilly, they put them back on.  Our server was amazing.  She was funny & attentive & did not mind when we told her we needed 8 different checks as we were there on business.\n\nThe food was amazing.  We all had drinks and appetizers.  I tried the homemade potato chips with a blue cheese dip.  Wow.  It was so good.  Dinner was a delicious Steak & Frites.  Cooked perfectly.  It was pricy, but so worth it.  The 8 of us sat there for hours and not once were we given a look that said \"Hurry up and finish so we can turn the table & make more money.\"  It was the best time I had that entire week & I look forward to going back."

So easy and convenient! \n\nThe place is wonderfully decorated and the staff was amazing! Wine selection was really good.\n\nThe warm brie appetizer was delicious and so were the homemade potato chips.\n\nThe four of us had the Steak and Frites and they did a wonderful job getting each steak cooked to our liking, since we all like our meat cooked to a different \"doneness.\"\n\nDefinitely worth coming again, especially if you want to treat yourself to a great time!"

  "text" : "I made reservations on Open Table for two at Mon Ami Gabi after reading all of the raving reviews here on yelp. We drove into Vegas on a Friday night and parked in the Paris Paris parking lot. After spending the next few minutes trying to figure out how to get to the restaurant from the casino, we arrived promptly for our reservation at 7pm. The waiting area was packed by the time we arrived. There was two lines, one with reservation and the other without. We waited about 15 minute before we were seated. We were seated inside next to the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains. I was hoping for this since the view of the fountains is one of the things noteworthy about this restaurant (being that it's across the street from the Bellagio). You could pay more for a better view and eat at the Eiffle Tower restaurant. We couldn't hear the music when the fountains were on but we were able to catch the fountain shows every time it went off (I think it was every 15 minutes).\n\nOur waiter arrived and explained to us the special. It was a bit difficult to hear him due to the noise but hey, it's Vegas and it was a Friday night. Given that it was a steakhouse, we decided to order the steaks. We were served bread while we waited. Our meals arrived about 20 minutes later. Portions were big and steak was cooked right.\n\nOverall, for the price, view, food, and service on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi is an excellent option. Place is very popular so reservations is highly recommended even on a weekday night because again it's Vegas."

  "text" : "Went here this past weekend. It's a great place. The only complaint I have about this place is the lack of vegetarian options in general, but I just blame that on the french. The view of the Bellagio fountain from this place is really nice. We sat in the area that's between outdoor and indoor seating with large glass windows to allow for the view and the sunlight. The other negative for this place is the long wait for outdoor seating (and they don't accept reservations for those. It's on a first come, first serve basis), but we were quite satisfied with the placement of our table. Try the fries and the vegetarian special that's not on the menu which is an open mushroom sandwich with a poached egg on top. The spinach quiche I hear is quite good but since I'm not a big quiche person, I didn't enjoy it very much. For dessert, their profiteroles are amazing!"

  "text" : "Our lunch stop while we were in Vegas, this place was a delight. Located on the main level of the Paris hotel and its patio extending onto the strip, this is a nice relaxing place to enjoy a near authentic Parisienne bistro experience. We were seated indoors in near the patio which was a perfect place cause it was still a bit chilly in the February air.\n\n\nWe were served water right away and I was surprised to discover a poor little ant trying to swim for his life in my glass. It was promptly replaced by the server who apologized and I received a fresh glass.\n\nWe decided to order a few appetizers and a bowl of their famous french onion soup and have it accompanied by a glass of Pinot Blanc.\n\n\nComplimentary bread and butter were quickly placed on our table before our food began to arrive in about 15 minutes. The fresh butter was great and the bread still warm.\n\n\nThe first appetizer that arrived was the Chicken Liver Mousse. What a fantastic dish. The pate mousse was delicious and was served with a small side of pickled onions and cucumbers and four pieces of slightly toasted bread. Partially drizzled was a most delicious hot mustard which provided just enough kick to compliment the pate. I was thoroughly impressed and the only thing that could have made it better would have been a few more pieces of bread as the serving size of the mousse was more than enough.\n\n\nThe escargot arrived with a surprisingly appetizing green coloured sauce which was actually the garlic herb butter. The six pieces of escargots had great heat (temperature) and as such was a pleasure to eat. The garlic herb butter was not too rich and added great flavour. I wouldn't go out of my way to order this item but it was good and so if you are in the mood for escargots then I would recommend this.\n\n\nWe ordered a half-order of the muscles and they arrived in good time.The muscles were a good size and the white wine sauce was so good that we were dipping the bread into it to get all the sauce we could in to our stomach. They were fresh and full of flavour.\n\n\nThe onion soup was to die for. Make sure that when you order this, you eat it as soon as it comes to your table as you want the cheese to be all melty and stringy. It was delicious and I would highly recommend this. If there's only one thing that you order, it must be the french onion soup.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic place for lunch with good service, great food, and a pseudo-parisienne  experience in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip."

So much, in fact, I started my day here twice on my last visit to Vegas.\n\nPart un: a rather large croissant sandwich with egg, tomato, avocado, turkey and just the right amount of mayo. Though I barely had room left, I also tried the fruit salad--delicious with mango, pineapple and grape, and yogurt and brown sugar on the side. While it set me back another $10 or so, it was hard not to indulge in a mimosa while enjoying the Bellagio fountain view and the bustling Strip just off the patio (they also offered Bloody Marys and a rolling wine cart among other morning libations).\n\nPart deux: quiche Lorraine, light and savory with bacon, cheese and chive. (It was hard to say no to the mimosa this time.)\n\nIn both cases, service was prompt, friendly and seemed effortless.\n\nIt looks like dinner here would be a hit as well, and the ambience offered in the evening is lure enough next time I'm in town."

The hostess offered either an one hour wait for the outside seating or no wait for dining inside. It's a no brainer, we will dine inside to satisfy out cravings for some fine French cuisine. The highlight of MAG is the authentic French bistro setting. You feel like you are dining in the middle of Paris. \n\nThe service was just average at best. Our waiter was very nonchalant  and seem to be a little impatient when we asked questions about the menu. The lowlight of the MAG dining experience was when the server pretty much threw the creme brûlée on the table. Seriously, is this the stereotyped rude French attitude that is expected? I guess I got a taste of the real French experience in terms of service.\n\nI ordered the steak classique with maître d'hôtel butter sauce. I found the steak to be really dry and tough to chew. The herb butter sauce was good but it couldn't mask the very thinly dryed out piece of steak. However, I tried out a piece of the filet mignon with butter red wine reduction sauce and it was excellent. The wine reduction was amazing and the filet mignon was very tender as expected.\n\nOverall, the view from the patio is unbeatable sitting across the Bellagio fountains if you are willing to wait for it. But, the service and steak frites were disappointing. I'm willing to try their brunch menu next time when I come back to Vegas. Although, I'm incline to try out the competition, Bouchon."

It came with frites (almost like fries) but crunchier.  I just fell in love with the place. (Hence, I wanted to give it five stars)\n\nThen stars started going down:\nI came here with friends (group of 4-7) a couple of times and I must say the service was absolutely horrible.  \nOne Time: They treated us like we were there to make trouble and always forgot any requests we asked.  Also,  they kept getting our orders mixed up and when we finally got our food, one of my friends order was completely wrong.  They did not even apologize to her.   We had to keep flagging them down to refill our waters & wine.  We couldnt wait to leave the place and it took our server a long time to get the check even though we asked for it like FIVE TIMES! One of my friends even left our server a little note on the receipt how badly he treated us. \n\nAnyways:  \nI usually order the steak classique with merlot butter (medium rare) and I always enjoy their steaks it never cease to impress me how good it is.  \n\n\nTip: I always put in a request to get a carrot salad, anyone who goes here should try the carrot salad! its really delicious! \n Always make sure you have reservations because every single time i go to Mon Ami, it is packed & make sure youre whole party is there because they will not sit you unless everyone is present."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi, what a popular place for Las Vegas visitors.  I was informed about the place on recommendation from my sister.  Many people pass by the place and see the outdoor patio and think to visit the location.  They have also many other locations throughout America which might also give them some word of mouth.  Reservations were made on Open Table with request to be seated indoors as close to the windows as possible to view the Bellagio fountains.  Reservations were for 7, arrived at 640 and was immediately seated at the table requested.  I'm gonna take more advantage of Open Table from now on specifically because of this!\n\nThe place has a dark romantic atmosphere, a little loud but still nice.  The rustic french feel added to the ambiance.  For food, I had the mussels marinere while K had the steak au poivre.  I regret not going for a steak.  Mon Ami Gabi is well known for their steaks and it seemed like many people in the restaurant either had some kind of steak of the mussels.  The mussels themselves were very big, hearty mussels but the flavor of the broth wasn't as infused as I'd like.  On top of that, the frites that Mon Ami serves were basically deep fried potato chips.  They were insanely thin and had not meat to them to give that starchy flavor to balance whatever  you are eating.  K had the steak which was tender and yummy with the sauce that was poured on top, for $25, this was a pretty good deal for right on the strip\n\nFor desert, bananas foster crepe with vanilla ice and creme fraiche.  Great desert, with the perfect mix of the banana foster mixed with a crepe.\n\n-1 star for the service: our waiter was a little creepy, awkward and talked to us strangely, his timing was really off\n\nOverall, an immensely popular restaurant that I wouldn't attempt to revisit without a reservation, a good spot for a reasonably priced steak on the strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains."

And this time I will express my displeasure with the service!!!!  \n\nWe had the biggest pompous ass for a server.  He was rude and condescending to our group and that was a HUGE source of displeasure in this latest experience.  \n\nThey were busy and some of our group had not dined there before but the menu is not rocket science and can be managed.  The salads are massive so we ordered and mentioned that each couple would split them and he crinkled his nose and walked away.   I had an offer for a speciality free salad and he treated me like I fell off the turnip truck.   When the salads arrived he kinda threw them NOT SPLIT and the free one wherever they landed.  \n\nThe steak frites were amazing as always and they were enjoyed by all.  However, I ordered the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel cream and was given bread pudding.  His fatal mistake was telling me that's what I ordered.  It was a special and not even on the menu and I always order the same dessert.  He told me to try it because i would be happy with that dessert.  I wasn't and begrudgingly returned with a comped chocolate dessert.  \n\nThis is how crappy personnel can make or break your experience....."

  "text" : "I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. If you go to Vegas and don't eat here and sit on the patio at least once you are missing out. We went here once for breakfast and then came back the next day for lunch. I would recommend making a reservation from OpenTable.com and then showing up a little early and letting the hostess know you're willing to wait for a table outside- SO worth it. Even if it's cold outside they have heaters that will keep you warm. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and you can't beat the view. For breakfast I had the eggs benedict which were cooked perfectly. I also had some of the coffee which was delicious & seriously the second I finished a cup the waitress was back to pour me a fresh one. For lunch, BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP OF MY LIFE. HANDS DOWN. I swear heaven opened up and the angels started singing as soon as I poked my spoon through the massive layer of cheese into that delicious broth. And - $7.50 glass of chardonnay. That is unheard of along the Strip, at least to my knowledge of any decent restaurant. Usually you are paying $10-12+ for a glass. Plus where else do they give your table it's own fresh, hot baguette?! I cannot wait to go back to Vegas and force everyone who is with me to eat there multiple times."

They have SO MANY OPTIONS! At least 4 different base mixes, olives stuffed with different special treats, cucumbers, jalapenos, at least 15 different hot sauces, Worcestershire, fresh ground pepper and BEEF JERKY!!! That absolutely blew my mind. I would never think to put beef jerky in my bloody mary but it was awesome!!\n\nI had the Croque Madame and it was sooo good. The ham was succulent, the bread was perfectly crisp, the egg on top was cooked to perfection, the cheese... everything was so good!!\n\nBF got the Nutella Waffle and it was unlike any waffle we had ever eaten. It was so crisp and light to the bite. The nutella was not overpowering and it was such a subtly beautiful waffle I just dream about it. \n\nOur server was awesome, our scenery was spectacular and without a doubt, whenever I am in Vegas I will for sure eat here, at least once!!"

I would happily drown in it, as long as I had five minutes to bathe in it and dip their delicious gluten free bread in it. In fact, if I ever go to jail and am on death row, you know exactly what I want as my last meal. MON AMI GABI.\n\nIt's hard to find restaurants that offer a gluten free menu at times. Mon Ami? BOOM! In your face, have it right on their posted menu everywhere in and outside of Paris. Let me tell you, it may look small, but you don't need variation. All you need is either A. Brunch, B. STEAK BEARNAISE or C. Seafood Platter.\n\nBrunch: For the fiance, a crepe filled with tender, juicy chicken and brie cheese. For myself, Eggs Benedict on, wait for it, GF BREAD! DELICIOUS! My fiance was silent the entire meal, and happily for him, so was I. PHENOMENAL. His crepe smelled like a beautiful spring morning relaxing at a small cafe in Paris. Yes, it reminded me of comfort and bliss. He said it tasted better than the smell. My Eggs Benedict? You saw the first sentence of this review. Enough said. Also, may I please advise you to get their BLOODY MARY BAR. Yes. MAKE YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY complete with several hot sauce options and oh, a BEEF STICK. THANK YOU DELICIOUSNESS!\n\nSteak Bearnaise: Please see first sentence. Just add beef and the most amazing steak frites I have ever had in my life and you have yourself a winner, winner, moo-cow dinner. $25 for a perfectly cooked medium rare steak with non-greasy or heavy steak frites. No ketchup or steak sauce necessary my friends. This is pure meaty heaven.\n\nSeafood Platter: If you don't like seafood, avoid it. If you like seafood, stick your head into the platter and enjoy the happiness that unfolds before your tastebuds. Simple, clean, perfect portion for two people and FRESH. There's no peculiar fish smell here; it's some of the best seafood I've ever had away from the east coast. Beautiful presentation and just perfect.\n\nGo here. Now. Immediately. DO. NOT. DELAY. Did I mention the bearnaise sauce yet...mmmm...\n\nP.S. The wait for the tables outside are worth if after 7:00PM with the Bellagio fountains going off every 15 minutes!"

We got our food extremely quickly and that was a bit of a bummer because we felt rushed and didn't get to savor our special meal.  French onion soup was delicious, very cheesy.  My husband had the much recommended Filet Minot Merlot and it did not disappoint.  I ordered scallops with butternut puree and brussel sprouts.  The butternut puree and brussel sprouts were very yummy. The scallops had little taste and I didn't finish them.\n\nLast time I was in Vegas we ate at the Lakeside in the Wynn and I would recommend it over this place for a truly special adult night on the town.

Most of the well-rated restaurants were way out of our budget in Las Vegas, or were a little too fancy to bring kids.  Luckily, we found Mon Ami Gabi!\n\nEveryone's meals were tasty.  I had the mushroom soup, the butter lettuce, goat cheese and apple salad, and the Seafood crepe.  The peas in the seafood crepe were so nice and sweet and fresh.  For the kids, they had the Mac and cheese which came with thinly sliced apples and skinny green beans.  It was so delicious!  I found myself picking at their plates quite often too!\n\nBottom Line:\nThe meals were reasonable priced, especially compared to all of the other restaurants in the area.

Don't make reservations until you know approximately what time you will come here because you may have partied the previous night and it may be difficult for you to wake up in time.\n\nIf you want the outdoor patio, there is a waitlist (first come/first serve) regardless of whether you made reservations. This waitlist is located at the front of the restaurant. In addition, when you make a reservation, at least ask them to place you as close to the front of the restaurant where you will get some sun.\n\nInitially, they gave us a nice loaf of warm french bread. It was pretty decent with a side of butter. Then, I ordered the steak with carmelized onions in a red wine reduction. It was quite delicious and tender.

  "text" : "I should probably point out that my trip to Mon Ami Gabi was a bit atypical.  A lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  While that might have been luck, I'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a Monday morning in early February.  Had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\n\nAlthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), I thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  Since my friend and I both wanted to try the Sea Scallop Gratinées, we decided to share an order while I went with the Croque Monsieur for myself.\n\n- Sea Scallop Gratinées (sea scallops with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=mAWQUpEJV5oBmFBVS95EbA) - the scallops were pretty standard, but I really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  Despite how good it was, I'm not sure I would get it again since I feel like I can find something comparable in SF.\n- Croque Monsieur (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=uHua_ESHqRFwEwM6xZ-KUQ) - pretty damn tasty.  Unlike others I've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and crème fraiche.  The corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  And the fries?  Delicious.\n\nWhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NoliktR7IHC8B3EkaJBwiQ) and the service.  Our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  What stood out though was how honest she was.  When I asked her about the soup du jour (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended I skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  I passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so I could see for myself...and she was right.  Not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\n\nConsidering it's The Strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but I can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  Still, the view alone might be worth the money.  With the Bellagio right across the street, I imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  That is, assuming it's on while you're there.  It wasn't for us..."

  "text" : "I gave Mon Ami Gabi another try recently after a horrific experience the last time I was there a few years ago (the waiter didn't take a food allergy seriously and didn't check with the kitchen). I realize that staff may come and go and my last experience wasn't the fault of the restaurant itself, so I gave it another chance because my girlfriend wanted to try it.\n\n The food probably won't be the most memorable part of your experience here; I'd venture to say it'll be the atmosphere. If you sit outside on the patio, you'll have a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio and plenty of people watching in the meantime. \n\n The prices are pretty reasonable given the location ($25 steak+fries) and the food does a reasonable job of representing the sort of fare you'd expect in a french cafe if it were cooked by an american chef that had learned to prepare the food by reading the menu. \n\n The service on my latest visit was much better. The waiter (Manuel according to the receipt) actually checked with the kitchen about my allergy and was back to me promptly with the confirmation that they do in fact (rather unusually) make their french onion soup with chicken stock (a bizarre allergy, I know). \n\n  My last visit mostly redeemed previous experiences and I'll probably give Mon Ami Gabi another go in the future if for no other reason than the view."

A little disappointed in the lack of Crepes on the menu as they had only Deseret Crepes. However my server explained that \"thin pancakes\" are really big crepes.\n\nI opted for the lemon and fruit \"thin pancakes\", with a double shot espresso and a fruit cup on the side. \n\nEspresso - Wow, I was super disappointed as I was imagining myself sitting in Paris sipping espresso in a cafe. This espresso was really bad. It was made perfectly (texture and color) but was bitter and just a bad roast. Now I am sort of a espresso snob coming from Seattle however I don't feel that having high expectations for espresso in a French Cafe is too much to ask. I expected an artisan roast and something very smooth, wrong.\n\nNow the thin pancakes were excellent. I was very happy with the flavor but the sheer size literally made me think this is so not French. It was massive and wasteful when it came to pure size of the pancakes themselves, however it was pretty stingy on the fruit topping (possibly 3 strawberries slices up). The flavor was very good and would have seemed somehow even better, if it were in short supply making me savor each bite. However with this huge portion it I ate until I was very full and still sent back half a plate of food. \n\nOverall a good experience but if you are a French Bistro in a French themed hotel; they might want to send the manager to France, Paris in particular, to see how the french really eat and live. It seems like a French Claim Jumpers or something when it came to portions, and a  jip of a coffee pastry place. I think they need to focus a little more on trying to serve great food and minimize the portions to a reasonable level and stop trying to be everything to everyone. I imagine accommodating the fanny pack crowd is a challenge as you have to to make ends meet on the strip however, most fanny packers are not ordering the thin pancakes and espresso. Do the IHOP thing on the American items but make some crafted products for people who are real foodies. You don't have to totally sell out to make the dollar.\n\nAs far as price, I was a little surprised considering the $25.00 bill with $5 tip. $30 for crepes and espresso? I think the espresso was $7 which actually made it even worse than the taste. I might go again, but I might not. Probably better places to fit my cravings when I get them."

I got the standard fare of 3 eggs with toast and bacon and coffee.  Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to go much higher than 3 stars for that or much lower. (OK, it's not hard to go lower, but it's pretty tough to screw that up)  The bacon was actually amazingly good - nice and thick cuts with what my burned out palate detected as somewhat maple-y as well.  The eggs were fine as was the toast and potatoes.  \n\nPerhaps, on another drunk weekend, I'll stop in and be more adventurous."

This place is fun for that reason.  The decor is fun and the patio allows for more the cafe or brasserie experience.   The wife and I escaped a group and happened upon this place and were pleasantly surprised.    Not the best french I have had by any means, but cocktails helped make it a fun lunch.  The frisee salad with a poached egg was nice, and so was the Salmon with spinach."

I had the special eggs benedict for the day and it was ridiculously good. Crazy good. It was the english muffins (made in house) with brie cheese, spinach, onions (I think? hard to remember)....but it was just sooo good. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise was the best I have ever had. I wanted to lick the plate. Additionally, it came with herbed hash browns that were more like very thin french fries....all over amazingness. Fresh and delicious. Now, the BF got the nutella waffle and he thought it was just alright. The description made it seem like it would have hazelnuts in it, but it was just nutella in waffles (I thought it was super good, but he thought it was just ok). The portion was a bit small for the price. The coffee was very tasty and the service was great! Coffee was never empty. Anyway, I would definitely come back here the next time I am in Vegas for breakfast...."

Wow, the salad was so great--I loved it and I was not really expecting much. On the other hand, the soup was good; the classic French onion soup. My husband had a steak with blue cheese, which was very tender and tasty. It's not a great cut of meat but they prepared it well. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, it was a little noisy and crowded but no more so than Bouchon.

I want some more...\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nA few friends had recommended MAG prior to my trip to Las Vegas earlier this month, telling me it was a prime spot for people-watching. Situated right on Las Vegas Boulevard (or \"The Strip\"), MAG was that and so much more.\n\nLocated within the Paris Hotel, directly under the Eiffel Tower, MAG welcomes diners with an authentic French experience right down to the decor. The cuisine could, at best, be described as French-American fusion. There's certainly something for everyone on the menu but with a twist that's a bit \"en Francais\".\n\nOver our three-day trip, my friends and I visited MAG twice: once for lunch and on our last day for breakfast. Both times we were more than impressed - particularly by the impeccable and attentive service. A table on the patio is worth the wait, but make reservations in advance if you're keen but short on time. \n\nMAG will be a must for me each and every single time I visit Las Vegas."

Feels disarmingly like Paris (I guess that's the point).  Actually, a little *too* much like Paris... it was difficult to wave down servers for tableware, sugar, another drink order, etc.  Not too difficult, just like I was in France rather than the tourist capitol of America.\n\nWhen you sit they give you warm bread.  Win.  Wonderful, delicious warm bread plopped right on the table with some butter. \n\nDecent onion soup, with a rich beef broth and melting caramelized onions- a little bit salty for me, but that's just me.  Melted cheese and a crouton on top.  Standardly solidly good, which is to say great since it's hard to get some standardly solidly good soupe a l'oignon in the US.\n\nINCREDIBLE frisee and warm bacon salad with poached egg and a citrus vinaigrette- we spent awhile trying to guess what made the dressing so good and we still have no idea.  The warm thick hunks of bacon went great with the light orange-y dressing.  We asked for extra bread to mop up the goodness.  Only wished there was a bit more frisee to balance out the heavy toppings.\n\nSeafood crepe: meh.  Scallops and shrimp were good, but I'd pass on this.\n\nThere are four stars here for that salad.  It's that good to bring a three star restaurant up to a four.  Yum."

Ok, there are plenty of places to grab a steak in Vegas with a decent view of the Strip, but I thought this place was excellent and a good price for what you get.\n\nWe had a group of five on a Friday night and walked right up and got a table inside right away (it was January, so we didn't want to sit outside).  The service was good, the only thing I thought was weird was serving their warm and fresh bread in a piece of parchment paper on a plate-- I mean, come on, even chains like Mimi's spring for a bread basket with a cloth napkin.  And yes, Mon Ami Gabi is a chain as well, but a small chain.  \n\nThe appetizers were fab-- escargot and scallops were the best in my opinion.  In fact, I think next time I'm back, I'm going to get two orders of scallops and a salad... and a steak too?  The wine and champagne we had were pretty good and fairly priced.  And the steak was perfect!  I ordered it pretty rare and they did a perfect job-- and what a deal for $25 for steak.\n\nDress code is probably smart casual-- you could get away with jeans.  We were pretty dressed up but didn't feel over dressed for a Friday night.\n\nThey also have breakfast and lunch that looked good on their online menu and after having dinner there, I'd go back for any meal.\n\nThe service was overall good, but I'd like a little more schmoozing ;)"

He refused to take empty plates off the table, the bread plate didn't get cleared until the end of the meal (pet peeve).

The weather outside was just perfect, nice and sunny, and we were lucky enough to catch a showing of the Bellagio water show while we were eating.\n\nThe wait staff is extremely attentive. Service was very good. Our food came out fairly quick. For an appetizer we ordered the baked cheese. No joke, this was the best cheeeeeeeeesilicious thing I have ever eaten. 3 different cheeses baked with marinara sauce and garlic bread. Holy moly was this good. We ran out of garlic bread fairly quick (there was only one piece *insert super sad face*) but have no fear cause there was a complimentary baguette (fresh baked) and we used that to top off the rest of our cheese.\n\nWe both ordered steak for our entree. It's a thin cut, not the usual chunk of meat I'm used to. But regardless, it was still delicious. Both our steaks came with something called frits. It's a mix between potato chip and french fry. But nonetheless, delicious with our steak.\n\nIf you want some brownie points with your girl, take her here."

The potato chips on the side was impressive but a bit too salty to eat alone. \n\nAmbience - Will definitely ask for an outdoor seat next time. The lights for the indoor seating was poor and not suitable for taking \"foodie\" pictures :P"

I'm hoping they take it to heart as I'd hate to see one of my favorite hotels go the way of The Sands, if you know what I mean.\n\nReally, our dinner here is what put me over the edge.  I went over a couple of the other reviews and noticed a pattern....\"I used to love coming here\" or  \"this time things were different\".....I too, noticed an exceptional difference.  I will say that I like the food here, I LOVE the view and I have had excellent service before, so, I know it can be done.  But, beware if you get server \"77\".  Yep.  Her name tag says, \"77\".  Trying to be polite, we did ask her for her name, but she seemed pretty annoyed to give it to us.  In fact, she just seemed annoyed.  She left 4 completely lighthearted people who were having a wonderful trip with a bad taste in our mouths.  \n\nGood thing for the Goat Cheese appetizer and mussels.  Only thing worth the taste this time around."

Both meals were fantastic and reasonably priced for Vegas at $26.95 and $23.95 respectively. The only complaint we had was that we made a reservation for 7:30pm with open table and were hoping to sit out on the patio.  When we arrived at 7:20 we waited in line to talk to the patio hostess who informed us that the reservations were only for inside and that there would be a 1.5 hour wait to sit on the patio.  We then had to get in the other line to speak with the indoor hostess who we made aware of our reservation to which she handed us a restaurant pager and said they would seat us in a couple of minutes.  It finally went off just as I was going to complain and possibly leave at about 8pm.   It probably wouldn't have been that big of a deal except for the fact we had show tickets for 9:30 at a different hotel. Luckily the the food and service were great otherwise and they served us very quickly. \nI would just recommend going early even if you made a reservation since the line was extremely long and people without a reservation were waiting over an hour even for inside seating."

It had way too much sweet flavor going on on such a thin sliced steak.\nMy friends got the broccoli and cheese crepe and it was gross.\n Another friend got the tuna melt sandwich, the presentation of this dish was nice but it was also gross.. All I could taste was the olive and I hate olives. \nMy other friend got the quiche and it was nothing special. \nThe only good dish was the prime steak sandwich with au jus sauce but I have had better in oc.\n\nThe service was eh.

My corned beef was really really awesome! It wasn't the normal corned beef in a can and the potatoes were crispy but tasty! My muffin was good, but not sure I would get it again at 3.95 a pop. The hubster enjoyed his sandwich and I thought it was a good price for how big it was. \n\nOverall, 40 something bucks for breakfast can be steep, but I definitely recommend coming here with guests or if you are an out of towner.

The aroma is rich, beefy and intoxicating and the taste delivers.\n\nThis is a great lunch spot with sandwiches like an authentic Croque-Monsieur, ham and Gruyere with bechamel, the prime steak sandwich served chilled with caramelized onions and mustard mayo with whole seeds, and a quiche Lorraine that melts in your mouth.\n\nBut I mentioned steak earlier. Let me come back to that. For $25 you get a plate of steak frites - I recommend the steak classique with maitre d'hotel butter or the steak au poivre with a delicious brandy peppercorn sauce.\n\nThe steaks and sandwiches are all served with frites, fried potatoes cut like the crunchy wonton strips you'd throw into a bowl of soup. These are among the best fries in town, simultaneously crispy and something you can really, literally, sink your teeth into.\n\nGreat view, great food, reasonable prices for Center Strip."

I made a reservation in advance so I was able to request a table on the patio. It was wonderful to dine outside with the sun shining, a front row seat to the Bellagio fountain show, and a great view for people watching. \n\nNow for the food..they served baguettes as the free bread! They were all warm and toasty in cute paper bags, like something you'd get from a bakery. I ordered the croque monsieur, which was pretty good. What I really enjoyed was the french fries that came on the side. They had an interesting flat shape which made them super crispy on the outside but still soft and chewy on the inside.\n\nThe next time I went was for dinner. I had the steak frites which was perfectly cooked and it was a very generous portion for the price of $25.95. The best part was, they let me have multiple sauces on the side at no extra cost. I tried the peppercorn sauce and the caramelized onion, red wine sauce; both were delicious. The baguettes were still free, unlimited, and just as good as I remembered.\n\nThe third time I went was for happy hour. I had 2 glasses of sangria, pate, and yes I had me some free baguettes. Then, I ended my very happy two hours with a warm chocolate pudding with salted caramel cream. It was absolutely decadent.\n\nAu Revoir mon ami, until next time!"

Or just wait till the buzzer calls you, but then, why did you come to Vegas for? Great place to people watch and have an overpriced sliced tomato with some stinky cheese called salad. The quiche is good too, if you like quiches. You get a baguette and some butter to start with, but don't spend too much, just enjoy the good weather and the funny dressed tourists taking pictures of the Eiffel tower."

Fellow Yelpers steered us right into the arms of Mon Ami Gabi. \n\nAfter a very short wait, we were seated in the sun room at a quaint little table across from the Bloody Mary Bar. (This was a BIG hit with my girlfriend!) Our server was friendly and attentive, and we loved the open-air, non-smoky environment. We all seriously felt like we could be back in Paris, sitting at an outdoor cafe. It was kinda perfect!\n\nWe all loved our meals- I ordered the chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe. It was a delightful meal, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back on my next trip!"

  "text" : "**Summary**\n       - Patio - The number one reason I'd come back is for the outside seating. You sit literally on the strip across from the Bellagio water show that plays every half hour. It's the the best outdoor style cafe experience in Vegas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q#NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q).\n       - Weather - I'd never come to Mon Ami Gabi to sit inside; so, I'd recommend checking the weather and reserve the day of. You wouldn't want a wind, rain, heat, or cold to ruin your dining experience. Unfortunately since this is Vegas, there aren't many temperate days.\n       - Steak - The steaks were thin and not from a good cut. I cut into a couple tendons throughout my dinner. They cooked them well, but it still didn't makeup for the poor piece of meat.\n       - Price to Quality - I'd say the price to quality of the steaks is pretty low. They cook them flavor-fully and well, but bad steak is still bad steak.\n       - Frites - All the steaks are served with these chip-like french fries. It was a nice change, but I think I'd still prefer mash if I could have it.\n**Ordered**\n       - $10.95 Escargots (in garlic-herb butter) - 6 delicious snails that were of decent size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ex6ZPq9Ver6siPR-2Sq0HQ#ex6ZPq9Ver6siPR-2Sq0HQ).\n       - $25.95 Steak Bordelaise (Caramelized onion, red wine sauce) - I liked this better than the other sauce. It definitely brought out the sweetness of the onions (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=bp-adB6a359T2vZJyZukFA#bp-adB6a359T2vZJyZukFA).\n       - $25.95 Steak Au Poivre (Brandy peppercorn sauce) - I like peppercorn, but I think pepper in this was a little overpowering (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=3xiPElJcOtMrOUnJyi2RHg#3xiPElJcOtMrOUnJyi2RHg).\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place and the weather is nice outside. Sitting outside, across from the Bellagio fountains definitely a unique experience. If you're not planning to sit inside, I'd say there are many other better places for this price."

Then the second waiter (probably lost) heckled us on what to drink even though I tried explaining that we have been helped already.  We ordered the Seafood Plater.  Very well done, but took longer than expected.  Our 3rd server had to come and let us know that they are behind (even though we came in at 11pm).  Lobster was well presented, shrimps were huge, and oysters were very fresh.  I hope it was just an off day on service, but still giving them 4 stars for the view and food."

You can people-watch as you eat. \n\nThe bread was so good.  They served whole WARM baguettes, which I have not had in too many restaurants.  The outside was not too stiff and the inside is just warm and soft :D \n\nWe ordered the first 3 steaks on the menu.. lol.  Excuse my English translation of the classy French names.. but we basically ordered the first 3 steaks, the classic with butter, the one with the wine sauce and one with the onions.  I had the last of the three.  Because of my usual experience with over-cooked steak at restaurants, this time, I ordered medium rare and Yay! it came out to be medium.  Not sure if that's a yay but use your own judgment.  The frites are really good and came in a huge portion along with the steak. \n\nService was excellent!\n\nDefinitely coming back :)"

The food was good but nothing amazing. the steak was very long but thin, and I prefer my frites a little thicker so I dont feel like I'm eating the crispy potato ends that no one wants.

I had the caesar salad, which was tasty.  The dressing was light and mild and my only complaint was that the salad was very small.

Top it off with a generous scoop of french vanilla bean ice cream.\n\nOverall, a good experience and wonderful food.

Nice ambiance especially if you are sitting outside at night during the spring/fall, solid service, and good food with a fairly varied menu that tends to be a bit heavy on the meat dishes.  Not the most friendly place to bring a vegetarian let alone a vegan.  Its not authentic, high-end French cuisine but then again it is Vegas.  \n\nSitting outside though can be a bit noisy with all of the traffic on the Strip.  You can hear your dinner companions but you have to speak up a bit.  The wait can be a bit outrageous though but that's common with any half-decent restaurant on the Strip.\n\nAll-in-all, there are a lot of terrible, overpriced restaurants on the Strip.

We had the French Onion Soup and warm brie to start - they were to die for!! For the main entree, we got the skate wing which was delicious. The only downfall was the steak bernaise - it was too finely \"pounded\" and thus no way for it to be cooked medium rare. It had no taste since it couldn't be cooked properly and our server agreed and had it taken off the bill. I would recommend the filet or any other cut of meat other than the hanger steaks that they offer. Service was excellent and I will absolutely be back."

Excellent hangar steak and of course the steak frites were amazing.

I was wrong.\n\nFirst let me begin by saying that I try to eat a mostly vegan diet, so the foods I ate here were not the steak or cheese dishes. The waitress was amazing! I didn't even say I was looking for vegan options but when I asked how the gazpacho was prepared and whether or not it has dairy in it, she picked up the cue and then began making suggestions on the menu, assuring me that everything was vegan.\n\nI had the grilled vegetable plate. Everything was perfectly seasoned and grilled. However nothing will compare to that gazpacho! I even requested the recipe which they emailed to me!\n\nSo why only four stars? Despite having a reservation, we were told that they did not do reservations for outside once we had already arrived, so we had to wait over an hour and a half for a spot. It was totally worth the wait, but we would have clearly shown up earlier if we didn't know our reservation wouldn't be outside. Miscommunication = cranky (but the gazpacho renewed my positive spirit.... did I mention the gazpacho yet?)."

Service and decor were a nice break from the hustle of the Strip; relatively quiet, dim mood-lighting, bistro style seating.\n\nWe made reservations for 930pm on a Monday night and were seated immediately indoors. Note, it was a 1.5 hour wait for outdoor seating even with reservation.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were offered water (so nice in 90 deg weather) and fresh sweet baguette complete with paper bag and slightly melted unsalted butter. Plus, compliments of the chef, we were given a nice plate of halved cherry tomatoes with herbs, olive oil and anchovies. Refreshing and so nice to set our appetites.\n\nHubby ordered one of the various Steak frites - \"hanger steak\", the cheapest cut at $20. Done very well at medium rare with a rosy pink interior. Thin ribbons of fries more reminiscent of potato chips and a few leaves of spinach for garnish. Also started with chilled gazpacho; surprising for a French bistro, but we were thrilled. We'd missed Alvalle gazpacho since being in Barcelona and hadn't found anything in the States that even came close (velvety, a bit of an olive oil with smooth tomato puree) until this.\n\nBeing vegetarian, I was pleased to see a Market Vegetable platter ($17.99) with eggplant dip and buttered crostini; buttered sauteed baby squash; cherry tomatoes in olive oil; ratatouille; sauteed garlic spinach; grilled bulb onions. All were very well done.\n\nPortions and service were quite nice. For a two dollar sign restaurant on the strip, it was a good deal.

I guess what picture I am attempting to paint is that I can't stand French anything. \n\nI wanted to find a really romantic setting for brunch with my lovely lady while we were in Vegas and wouldn't you know it. I was Yelping my ass off for like 3 days, no luck. Then, I saw Mon Ami Gabi pop up on the homepage and some girl gave it 4 stars, so I said that's the place, no matter what. I didn't know it was Frenchy til I saw it was at hotel Paris and by that time, it was really too late. I already dove in the pool so it was time to swim.\n\nThe place was bonkers packed when we got there, but I made a reservation through Yelp and we bypassed the blue haired ladies stankin' up the joint with their strong ass Avon perfume and were seated inside, but in the solarium. Perfect people watching seats, right in front and not baking in the sun. \n\nCoffee = Strong = Bon (that's French for good) \n\nFrench Toast was bomb! Fresh bread, crunchy goodness on the outside and soft, warm gooey center. Blueberry compote/syrup wasn't too sweet and adds a nice tartness that I only wish I could replicate at home. \n\nSide of bacon was crispy, greasy (in a great way) and so delicious! It clearly wasn't cooked in a pan b/c it didn't have that funky curl to it. It was nice and flat. I was hoping for a side of the bacon grease to lather myself up with as we sat poolside, but that's a bit excessive. \n\nElizabeth ordered the traditional breakfast and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice and runny, just the way she likes it. Hash browns were crispy, French muffin (English muffin but follow along please) served with freshly whipped butter, which was delicious, creamy and delightful. \n\nThe service was fantastic and I didn't know what to expect b/c the place is jumpin with tourists, everyone wants first class service and I don't know about anyone else, but we got it. For example, as we were being seated the hostess chatted us up with some basic chit chat and pulled the chair out for both of us, nice touch. \n\nI love that I can trust Yelp to pave the way for a lovely event. Thanks for the love Yelpers!"

  "text" : "After a few nights of 4 AM, post-drinking room service meals, my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go somewhere good for dinner. We chose Mon Ami Gabi and we were sooooo glad we did! We had reservations on a Tuesday night at 10. We were seated right away in the front room and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nOur waitress was great and gave us some great suggestions.  For appetizers, we had pate, escargot and scallops. All three were amazing. Escargot has always been a little scary to me, but I sucked it up and tried one and it was SO delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I'm not a huge fan of pate but I had a little and I had to admit it was pretty tasty. For entrees we both had filets-- merlot for me, Roquefort for him. Mine was awesome. Perfectly cooked and drenched in butter and a red wine reduction--how can you go wrong with that??? The filet Roquefort was also good but I'd definitely pick the filet merlot again. The frites were more like potato chips than I was expecting but I enjoyed them nonetheless. After all that food, we were pretty stuffed but the butterscotch pot de creme was screaming our names, so we gave in and ordered it. I think that might be my new favorite dessert. It was rich but not too heavy, like butterscotch pudding only a gajillion times better. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, especially for what you get. It was very busy the night we were there (and I'm assuming it's like that pretty much every night) but our food still came out very quickly. Other than feeling like elephants when we were done, it was one of the best meals either of us has had in a long time and definitely the best one we had in Vegas!"

  "text" : "My last review I wrote some snarky shit about the hostesses and I feel like a jerk for that. This time we came in and they were all so friendly and welcoming. She carried conversation with us about where we were from and all that sort of chat on our way to a (Woohoo!) patio table by the sidewalk. \n\nLet me say that I love this place. I live in Vegas and I feel like I'm on vacation every time I go there. As most every other place on the strip it's too much of a hassle, or sleazy, or just loud but this place is worth it (and I can finally zip to Paris pretty quickly, as long as a mob of people crossing the valet sidewalk doesn't stop me for ten minutes.) Not here. \n\nIt's classy and fun and the food is delicious! We went for breakfast and I had the fruit boquet with mint syrup (who knew?! It was amazing!) and a blackberry muffin - also ridiculous. It melted in my mouth. \n\nMy friend also had a fruit plate and a baguette. Everything was fresh and the portions are just the right size. The cappuccino was over the top gigantic and one of the best I've ever had. The large comes served in a bowl. We got to sit and people watch and have a nice breakfast. \n\nIf you go, ask for Debbie. She was fast and nice I didn't even have to ask for anything because it would already be there. I work in the industry and not only was it not the typical \"service\" the strip is so well known for not providing, she made us feel welcome and like we mattered."

We started with the smoke salmon with creme fraiche and it was very tasty and fresh. We then ordered the French Onion Soup that was a nice size for two people to share. I also ordered the chilled gazpacho which was prepared perfectly and was also a large portion. My husband ordered the steak and I ordered the grilled chicken. Come hungry here because the portions are definitely Americanized and not the typical french size portions as I was expecting. My chicken was cooked nicely and not dry at all.\nWe saw another guest eating the baked goat cheese in a marinara sauce which looked like a good dish to try as well.\nour table was right next to the patio and we got to view the Belaggio's show throughout the dinner.\nWe will definitely be going back.

  "text" : "I kinda feel bad for giving this place a 3-star rating, but here goes.\n\nI've wanted to try this place forever, and although I knew I should have come here for breakfast, it just wasn't happening with the party I was with.\n\nWe came here for dinner on a Friday night, 7 PM.  We had reservations through Open Table, but really, it looked like you didn't need one.\n\nWe were seated in semi-outdoor area that was clear but protected from passerby, smoke, etc.  The view of the water show at the Bellagio was great.\n\nBaguettes with a little bruschetta and butter came out.  The food was taking a bit long to come out, so thank goodness that was there.  Our waiter wasn't exactly the most friendly person but at least went through the motions.  The south point for me was when one of the people in my party, a diabetic, asked that his frites be substituted with some green salad or something with his filet mignon.  The waiter told him he couldn't \"We don't do that\", and said he'd have to order a side of spinach or something on the side and kept saying that they'd charge for it.  Nowhere on the menu did I see \"no substitutions,\" and if there is even a gluten-free menu, I'd expect they'd be a little more considerate in swapping fries for a few measley leaves.\n\nSpeaking of measley leaves... another person in my party ordered a caesar salad -- now, these salads aren't cheap -- about $17-$19, and it was honestly one of the smallest I had ever seen -- no crutons, either.  I got the seared ahi tuna salad, which was comparably small with only three pretty small pieces of kind of grey ahi tuna.  I've had this dish at other, less fancy places and got bigger and better tuna.  I didn't really eat a lot of the salad because it otherwise was just average in taste.\n\nTo their credit, the chicken dishes, sea scallops, pate mousse, and filet mignon seemed to be enjoyed by the rest of my party.  Of course, everything was smothered in butter, seemingly.  Also, the frites that came with many of the dishes were like shavings of fries and not really good, in my opinion.\n\nI'd come here again for the breakfast, but the dinner was pretty disappointing to me.  I guess we paid for the view."

But the flavor combination was delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly.\n\nFor dessert, I shared the bananas foster crepe. I can't remember if this was amazing or just good...

  "text" : "I was in Vegas for the last week of April on vacation and we decided to eat at Mon Ami Gabi for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We had reservations for 9pm but then realized we'd be best off walking to the restaurant (from the Mirage) which would take a bit of time so I bumped it back to 9:30. Wouldn't you know we arrived a few minutes after 9pm afterall! The restaurant was PACKED with a line for people without reservations and a line for people with reservations. Luckily we had reservations and although early, we were seated right away. \n\nWe were hoping for a seat on the outside patio area but that would have added a 45 minute wait so we ended up in a covered area between the inside and outside. The doors to the patio were open so we had a clear view into the night and a pretty awesome view of the Bellagio fountains across the street!\n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their meal. The bread they brought with butter was delicious. Hard to stop eating but I had to because I'd ordered a soup appetizer. I went with the creamy mushroom soup. If you like mushrooms you'll definitely enjoy this soup! And how could I resist dipping some bread into it? I couldn't. But I will say that the soup was so delicious, I preferred the soup solo without the added heaviness of the bread. \n\nI ordered the hangar steak with frites, med rare. My friend (she ordered a different cut) also ordered steak and frites but her steak was unevenly cooked. She still enjoyed and at it all! But did want to share that. My steak on the other hand was perfectly cooked. She wasn't crazy about the frites (too crunchy) but I loved them! I couldn't stop munching away on them even after feeling FULL! \n\nOur waiter was extremely attentive without being obnoxious, the third person in our group sneakily told the waiter it was my friend's birthday and they brought her out a dessert. I'm not sure what it was exactly but we all ate from it and really enjoyed it! It was delicious! Ok looked up the menu. It must have been profiteroles. Yummy!\n\nGood food, great service, excellent experience, and enough variety on the menu that if you're on a budget you can eat well without breaking the bank. If I ever return to Las Vegas, I will absolutely look to return to Mon Ami Gabi."

The place was packed so it was understandable, we chose to sat inside.  I was pleasantly surprised with the menu prices though, I'd heard so many good things about the food and that it's fine dining, so assumed it would be much more expensive. I ordered the Hanger Steak with merlot butter for $19.95 (!) and it was really really good.  Reminded me of the dish at this restaurant Cowgirls in NYC near the meatpacking district I used to frequent (they appear to be closed now).  My friends got the arctic char special and the filet mignon, which were both really good. We also ordered the chicken liver mousse and the baked brie appetizers, both were delicious and worth coming for.  They also bring fresh baked bread for every table and you can ask for more.  This was helpful for the appetizers when we ran out of crostinis.   Service was really good and our waitress checked on us frequently.  We were too full for dessert but it looked awesome."

She didn't sound like any french person I know or have known and certainly didn't look french, but c'est la vie, she was perfectly attentive and made suggestions we all could appreciate.\n\nI had the corned beef hash with poached eggs and english muffin.  The corned beef is housemade and chopped/shredded... SOOO flavorful and meaty.  There was very little 'hash' but that's fine with me.  I'm more of a protein lover anyway.  The english muffin was homemade and was awesome.  \n\nTwo of us ordered their thin pancakes/thick crepes- both were extremely happy with their choices.\n\nThe fourth of us ordered the Nutella waffles and her comment to me just now was, \"...and they were VERY yummy.\"  'nuff said.  \n\nThe only complaint one of us had was with their hot chocolate.  I have some picky kids when it comes to that drink and when there is too much foam from the steamed milk or they use too much sugar or a powder mix or a syrup that tastes too much like Hershey's, the satisfaction is less than stellar.  The hot chocolate had too much foam and was too sweet (and, personally, $4.50 for the 5 oz?  Yeah, not exactly cost effective for me.)  \n\nAll in all, we were VERY happy, VERY satisfied and highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi!  (Even though I hate the hotel they reside in...)"

This is a busy place and communication isn't as thorough as you may be used to so keep your guard up. \nLess importantly, when they say that you get gluten free bread it is infact just a couple of slices of toast. It's good for premade - Udi's quality if not Udi's itself, so enjoy.\n\nMy reason for giving 4 stars and not 5 is that the serving sizes are inconsistent. You'll have to look at other people's orders to see if the main course is enough or if you need to add an appetizer. Entrees are $18-$35 apiece. Appetizers I recall being around $10"

I've passed it many times in the past and never paid any mind to it but after a friend recommended it as a fave spot, I had try it and boy was it worth it!  I started w/ the white egg omelette w/ turkey and Brie and though it was healthy it was like no other concoction I've ever had.  It was topped w/ a tangy avocado relish that was out of this world.  To finish we had the skinny cinnamon pancakes and it was perfection.  Just right sweetness and texture.  Will def be back every time I visit Vegas!!"

  "text" : "So we were walking down the strip and came across this place inside the paris hotel & casino at first we were a little bit unsure whether to go or not because the wait was 45mins but you know what it's Vegas so thats how it is! Eventually we got into our seat and right away the server put the complimentary bread on our table I thought thats very nice of them after waiting 45 mins. The servers are very nice and professional they were able to explain the food that we wanted to get and even gave me a sample wine to make sure thats the wine that I wanted. We ordered the chicken liver (pate) omg i love pate their pate is oh so good with the bruschetta bread. Also ordered the steak omg one of the best steak I have ever had because I personally didnt even need the steak knife to cut it because it was tender enough also dont need the steak sauce as it comes along with their special sauce. I finished the whole steak not because its a small portion but because it was too delicious and it is too unusual for me. When it comes to dessert we had the friteroles (whatever you call it) gosh its so good!!!! I am definitely coming back here I just love it and the price is very good too just reasonable and suitable! Awesome! Love it!"

First of all, their patio seating is literally the best in Las Vegas because you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from across the street! It is an amazing environment to be in. You will feel like you are in another part of the world.  The management was very helpful in accommodating our large party and even when we had more guests join us last minute they were helpful.  Now the breakfast...the turkey and avocado breakfast croissant was sooo yummy. I will definitely be back for more."

It took a little bit of a wait to get a patio seat, but the ambiance was great! The food took a little bit longer to come out than anticipated, so after waiting for the patio seat AND my dinner, man I was starving!\n\nI ordered my steak medium, it came out perfect.

Perhaps it was just my luck...but they sat us at a table where a large amount of spilled ketchup was all over the floor underneath the table.  They reseated us at a different table, but did not offer any apology....for the mess that attacked our feet.\n\nOnto the food...I ordered the seafood crepe...the seafood was fresh and delicious and well flavored but I felt the crepe was rather unremarkable.  I've definitely had better crepes.  The fries that come with their sandwiches and burgers are delicious...really they aren't fries...they seem more like kettle chips in the shape of a fry.  And they are very addicting!!\n\nThe food took over an hour before it arrived at our table....and our waiter when we were trying to pay for the check was no where to be found....for a establishment on the strip...overall the service here is horrible and the food is at best slightly above mediocre."

  "text" : "Unfortunately for Mon Ami Gabi, my rating is influenced largely by the way their staff handled a recent incident that occurred while I was eating there. \n\nWe arrived at Mon Ami Gabi after the 7:00 showing of the Jersey Boys. Our reservation was not until 9:30, but they were able to seat us immediately at 9:15. We ordered the Warm Brie Cheese, which the menu states is served with black pepper honey, hazelnuts, and croutons. While I still enjoyed the dish, there was actually only ONE hazelnut on the plate. \n\nFor our main courses, I ordered the French Onion Soup and my sister ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad. The soup was fine as far as French Onion Soup goes. My sister said the individual components of the salad were fine, but trying to eat all of the different parts together made for a strange taste in her opinion. \n\nWhen it came time to pay, I reached down next to my chair where my purse had been sitting during the entire meal to retrieve my wallet, only to find my purse was not there. I had gotten my phone out of it just a few minutes prior, so it had definitely been there during the entire dinner up to that point. I alerted the waiter of what happened, and he said he was going to get the manager. About 10 minutes later, a manager arrives at our table asking what happened. He informed us that he had only been working there for a month and did not know what sort of assistance they could offer me. I asked if we could view surveillance footage and he said that they did not have the \"authority\" (according to the actual senior manager of the restaurant, who neglected to address the situation in person with me at all). \n\nOnce we had hit a dead end within the restaurant, security guards from Paris showed up. They continued to ask if I \"was sure\" I hadn't left my purse in the restroom, or at the show I had previously been at. At this point I was sick of people acting as if it was my fault that someone had taken my property. We filed a \"lost and found\" report with the hotel, and I went back to the restaurant to be sure there was nothing else they could do to help me out (which they claimed there was not). After all, we were leaving in the morning and my purse contained my id. Getting through airport security without an id is not the easiest task... \n\nYou would think that after the inconvenience of having your purse stolen at the restaurant, they would have offered some sort of condolence, or offered to comp at least our appetizer, but they offered nothing of the sort. No apology, no help. I would not go back to this restaurant for that reason alone. But then, when I finally got back to our hotel, I began to get sick, and I was sick for the rest of the night. Quite the ending to my trip, I must say."

  "text" : "One of the best fancy schmancy values on the strip. Any place with a \"great view of the Bellagio fountains,\" whether it be a room, a restaurant, or the ledge in front of the Bellagio fountains, brings 'em out. The first come, first served patio wait list is long and they overtly try to dissuade you from it, but as long as you're okay with plopping yourself in front of some slots or video poker to lose a bit of dough while you wait, it's just fine. And once you are seated...boy, that view! It's a wonder there aren't more Strip restaurants out near the street like Mon Ami because the effect is great - the fountains, Eiffel Tower, and the flanking Cosmopolitan and Caesars make your seat in the middle of it all both intimate and grand.  \n\nThe service was excellent - we even had an authentic French waiter. The bistro fare menu and prices are completely reasonable given the location, and the food is delicious, from my perfectly cooked hanger steak to the skate wing I tried, the gentle wine selection (not bold enough to rock you but a solid complement to the food), and of course, the pre-dinner baguette. It's places like Mon Ami that really make Las Vegas a well-rounded vacation spot these days, at least for the foodies that want some wine with their sequined cheese. Oh, and as date material, let's just say my panties would have been flying, if I'd worn any."

The lighting is perfect and it is right across the street from the Bellagio fountains which you can see from the patio and from inside. Our server was also great. He was very attentive and even make us laugh a few times without being overly goofy.\n\nThe bad. And it was bad. We ordered an appetizer of assorted seafood which included whole lobster, tuna tar tar, jumbo gulf shrimp and oysters. The oysters were mishandled and had pieces of shell in them. The lobster was lacking flavor. It tasted bland. However the gulf shrimp were good as well as the tuna but for the price of the plate my husband and I were severely underwhelmed. Second course, pork chops and frites. The pork chop was incredibly dry, the seasoning was good but the pork should had been pulled from the fire a good 10 minutes earlier. We ate it but later hit the food court in our hotel for sub sandwiches that we liked so much better. I would not go back to Mon Ami Gabi for food but I would go back for drinks on their patio. The view is fantastic."

  "text" : "Well, with 1800+ reviews, I'm not sure if mine will make too much of an impact, but here goes! \n\nMy 4-star rating is in regards to their lunch-- I've never dined here for dinner, but I have heard good things about that as well.\n\nNo matter the day, try to make reservations if at all possible, especially if you're planning on eating around 11:30-1:00. They have beautiful seating on the patio and in the \"bubble\" -- like an atrium, this area is covered by glass with great views of the strip. This is our favorite location to eat in the restaurant as I personally feel that service can suffer farther out on the patio.\n\nInto the food:\nAppetizers: \nTheir Sea Scallops Gratinées is a completely flawless dish-- tender scallops served in a sort of seashell presentation, topped with a carmelized onion marmalade, mussel cream, and carmelized fennel(?). While this normally would not appeal to me in the slightest, this is probably the dish I look forward to most when coming to Mon Ami Gabi! These are downright delicious and should definitely not be passed up. I believe there are 3 in an order. \nFrench Onion Soup: My favorite of all time. Nowhere else have I dined at has surpassed MAG's french onion. I can't even describe it anymore without my mouth watering...a ton of sweet onions throughout is what I love most about this. I can't explain anymore without saying to just get this!!\n\nMain dish:\nWarm chicken & brie sandwich: This is quite the item. The chicken is pounded flat and is incredibly tender. The brie is smooth and is a great mix with the green apple slices (also thin) and the spread of carmelized onions (notice the trend with the onions...ha! I love them.) I forget the bread it is on, but it's extremely soft and a perfect match. However, I could pass on their fries. They're so thin, they become crunchy, almost like chips. But, to each their own!\nI've had a few others, but this has been my favorite by far. \n\nDessert: \nWarm Apple Tatin: Extremely French taste, presentation, etc...I was transported back to France just tasting this. It's difficult to explain this item, but it is a round crust (bottom and sides) and it has baked, carmelized apples in the middle. Served with amaaaaazing whipped cream. Worth every calorie!\n\nBottom line: One of the best places on the strip for lunch that is decently priced. Give it a shot-- I bet you'll love it!"

Be prepared at peak times to wait over an hour for that if you want.\n\nService was quick and efficient from beginning to end, appetizers fantastic (goat cheese/tomato dip? wow), and entrees were cooked perfectly.

So after trying to decide between 2 places we went with Mon Ami Gabi.  Since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  \n\nWe were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter Scott.  He was all smiles kinda reminded me of Marc Anthony.  Very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.\n\nStarted off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  \n\nSea scallops gratinees ~ was broiled to yummygoodness I could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  \n\nMussels Mariniere ~ Cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  They were very good.  \n\nScallop potato and green beans that came with the Prime rib was very addicting.  The scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. \n\nPrime Rib ~ This was one huge honker of a prime rib.  Cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  It was juicy and tender.  Mmmm Meat!\n\nSkate Wing ~ One thing I always order when its on the menu.  If you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  Its sooo damn good.  I could have eaten 2 of these things.  Its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  \n\nAfter pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.\n\nBananas Foster Crepe ~ It wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in New Orleans but it had the right flavor.  It was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in Vegas.\n\nEyes ~ Great place to people watch and catch the show of the Bellagio fountains.\nNose ~ Smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!\nEar ~ Its a typical dinner time vibe!\nMouth ~ Really tasty good stuff!\nTummy ~ Everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!"

For dinner, the ambiance is very French and romantic: dim room with candles at all tables. It's not quiet, but the place looks so romantic. For food:\n\nThey provide complimentary RADISH SALAD and BAGUETTES with butter. I loved the radish salad. It was refreshing and a bit sweet. The baguette was yummy too. They serve it warm and comes in a paper bag. Every time I think of baguettes, I just wanna get into a sword fight with it. I didn't do that of course, gotta be a lady.\n\nFor my main course I had the SALMON and LEEK QUINOA. So yummy! The salmon was cooked just right: a bit crispy but tender. My mouth is kinda mouthwatering because of it. The quinoa had a little too much sauce in it but I still liked. For a side dish, I had the RATATOUILLE. Not bad, I just wish it was a bit more creamy.\n\nBeth, our server, even hooked it up with a complimentary dessert: vanilla ice cream in a profiterole? Not sure but it was yummy!\n\nMerci beau coup Mon Ami Gabi :)"

This time, I wasn't going to let a night of rage or throbbing headache stop me.\n\nProbably would've enjoyed the food and ambiance a lot more if I wasn't so ridiculously tired.  The table was dead silent as everyone attempted to keep their composure and heads up.  \n\nOrdered: \n- Chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe: Delicious!!  If my stomach wasn't at odds with me, I would have finished every bit of it.  \n- Side of fruit: I was hoping for a small bowl of fresh whole fruit but instead got a fancy diet saucer filled with cut up soggy fruit.  They could have skipped steps \"cut\" and \"drench in fruit slime.\" \n\nThe baguette served as a nibbler comes out in a long, warm roll.  Crumbly, soft, chewy, and fresh!\n\nNo swimwear.  Probably a good idea to make reservations on busy days like Saturday.  Service was casual but my water glass was always filled.  I look forward to coming back...sober!"

I did a quick search on Yelp to see what was around the area and came across this place which was only 1 hotel over. It had great reviews and it had steak so that was a plus! We get ready and head over to the place and the restaurant looked nice. They had patio seating and inside seating. Surprisingly the patio seating was faster then trying to get a seat inside. The patio seating is right on the strip and right across from the Bellagio. It sets a nice mood for couples because you get to see the water show while eating. The prices are very good for being in vegas and on the strip. When seated they give warm french bread and radish salad that I really liked. We ordered a full order of mussells, escargot and everyone got a steak dish. The mussells and escargot were delicious! All the steaks came with thin cut frech fries there were really crispy. The steak was a good portion for the price. This is a great place to check out for cheap and good food with a nice view."

It was warm outside and we had an awesome view of the Bellagio water show.\n\n3.5 stars for the food, which was just okay. Not bad for being a moderately priced sit-down place in a Vegas hotel on the strip.\n\nFrench onion soup was way too sweet for my taste and a bit over-salted as well.

They were extremely short and flat pieces of fried potato that were sliced so thinly that I couldn't taste the starchiness of the potato. I think my friend was shoveling big fork-fulls of those fries into his mouth at one point because the pieces were so tiny.

My first time trying Escargot and I'm a fan.\nA group of friends decided to have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi, knowing how good it was we couldn't resist. We made reservations, for 18 people, unfortunately they couldn't keep us all at the same table but the tables were near each other.\nOur waitress, Christin, was fantastic, she's been working there for 12 years so she knew exactly what to recommend for your taste.\nThe free loaves of bread are so good, not anything like the tasteless bread you get in real Paris. Flawlessly accompanied by butter and a carrot slaw to spread on your bread. The fish of the day was Barramundi with pole beans over a light tomato sauce. It was cooked perfectly, with a nice crisp skin, seasoning was excellent on my fish as well as my vegetables. My husband ordered the chefs special of the day which was a Prime Rib Roast with long beans and scalloped potatoes. He ate every morsel, the only thing I tasted were the potatoes, which I thought were a bit peppery for my taste. Everyone else in our group seemed to love their food, some of the orders included Trout Almondine, Steak, Seafood Platter, Shrimp cocktail, Sea Scallops, and Onion Soup just to name a few.\nFor dessert we ordered Creme Brulee to share, it was an enjoyable ending to our meal, light creamy vanilla custard with a nicely caramelized top layer. Yum!"

We were not disappointed! *phew*\n\nWe ordered escargots for appetizer and i was hesitant to order it because i've never tried it and was worried i wouldn't like it. BUT, i LOVED IT! The only thing about this dish is that its a bit on the oily side. It was still delicious nonetheless, however the escargots were drenched (LITERALLY) in garlic-herb butter which im not sure if thats usually how they're made. It was good though.\n\nHe ordered steak frites which is apparently what they are famous for and the steak was perfectly seasoned (i usually find steak too underseasoned) and the frites were really cool. They were more like chips than fries because they were so incredibly thin! But i liked how thin they were cuz they didn't taste as oily as normal fries even though they probably are.\n\nI ordered peppercorn sauce steak and green beans. It was also delicious. The meat was cooked exactly the way i wanted it and was very tender."

We had the country pate and the scallop entree. Both were good. We also had a salad which was just okay, nothing special. The menu read really well but there was something lacking when it arrived.\n\nOur server, #71, was the only thing that made our dining experience not so impressive. She was boring and wasn't willing to really give us any suggestions or details. She made us feel like we were such an inconvenient to her. I wished we would have sat in another section. \n\nIt's shouldn't matter if we were there for lunch or dinner, service is such an important aspect of dining that it shouldn't be neglected.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience. This is definitely a place that I might want to come back to give it another chance. Hopefully, we won't get the same server.\n\nHappy eating!"

After 10:30am you have to order from their Brunch Menu which has a couple of Breakfast dishes.  We made reservations since we had a large group but ended up getting tables on the Patio (The Patio is First Come First Serve). The BF ordered the Braised Beef Eggs Benedict and I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.  I think I preferred the Braised Beef Eggs Benedict it came Braised Beef, caramelized onions, and their yummy yet fatty hollandaise sauce on top of an extra toasty English muffin. The Braised Beef had so much flavor and was really tender loved it! The Smoked Salmon came with hollandaise sauce on top of an extra toasty English muffin. I felt the smoked salmon was a little too salty for my taste. Both plates came with a side of extra crispy hashbrown Yum! Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"

  "text" : "A nice spacious restaurant! This hotspot is located at the base of Paris hotel and is alongside the sidewalk of the lively Las Vegas Blvd.  My visit to Mon Ami Gabi evoked flashbacks of my time in Paris mid-summer. To my surprise, the decor and food accurately captures the essence of a French restaurant.\n\nMy favorite aspect of this exquisite eatery is the affordable pricing and the wide selections on the menu. For less than $20, you can already have a good amount of food. I enjoyed my Prime Steak sandwich, which had tender and succulent meat between two soft freshly-baked bread.  When I took a bite the Warm Chicken and Brie sandwich, my mouth rejoiced after tasting the flavorful yet delicate combination of the ingredients put together.  The marriage of brie cheese and chicken provides a high enjoyable level of savoriness.  Mon Ami Gabi was able to bring sandwiches above and beyond the expectations I normally have. \nEvery sandwich (and many dishes) comes with a small basket of crispy potatoes.  They are similar to french fries as well as potato chips and compliment the entrees wonderfully with their lightly salted crispiness.\n\nThe service is wonderful as the workers are knowledgeable about everything on the food and wine menu.  One of the IMPORTANT things to anticipate upon arrival to Mon Ami Gabi is the shirt policy.  Male customers must wear a shirt with sleeves (essentially no tank tops).  One of the people in my party unknowingly did not wear a shirt with sleeves to this restaurant.  However, the workers were nice enough to provide him with a complementary Paris hotel t-shirt.  Is the service great or what?"

Then they bring your bread in a bag so you can tear off pieces just like we did in France when I visited.  For starters we gobbled down a duck confit and fingerling potatoes appetizer that was prepared so well, even the 7 3/4 year old loved it.  I was in a rare fish mood and ordered the dover sole special which was a bit underseasoned but cooked perfectly otherwise.  My wife ordered the filet and they allowed her to choose the blue cheese sauce (any sauce on any steak our waitress said).   The steak was perfectly cooked (thank god she ordered medium because it came closer to medium rare, the way I like it.  the potato sticks were the best thing we had, the perfect crispness and saltiness.The waitress was very helpful in providing recommendations and they kept the water full.  The drinks, although pricey, were excellent. Try the Paris Romance.  Also the French Cherie was excellent.  I forgot Hendricks was in it due to the flavor.\nThe child had fish sticks that were awesome and came in a french bento box with mashed potatos, green beans and more.\n\nFor desert, the kids ice cream sundae was good and 1/3 the price of the sundaes across the street at Serendipity.  We had the profitteroles and must have liked them because they were all gone when we left.\n\nI want to give this place 5 stars, I really do but the dining area is small and noisy and the fish special just wasn't perfect.  I am sure I would have given it that extra star if we had a spot on the patio but they were full and the wait would have been 1 hour.  I promise to revisit this the next time we go."

But, in this case, that is exactly what they are going to get. A not bad rating, that is.\n\nAnd judging by the relative lack of positive reviews of this establishment just kidding I have to say that they will likely see a huge surge of traffic after I click Save Now, followed by Post. Because my positive reviews bring all the boys to the yard, and in this analogy, the yard is this restaurant and the boys really are people of any gender that are willing to eat very tasty french inspired steak while likely sitting on a patio that is directly across the street from the Bellagio water fountain shows\n\nRun on sentences are nothing to scoff at.

The chocolate croissant was flaky, buttery, and the chocolate was semi-sweet; perfect, in my opinion ($~4).  The croque madame was rich, buttery, crispy, cheesy, and the egg was cooked to order (~$12); comes with their version of fries (different from other restaurants - thinly sliced potatoes that are roughly cut into to strips.  The results are crunchy, some tender potato sticks).  Coffee is ~$4.  The steak frites was good and the steak portion was very generous (~$25).  Yummy stuff here, folks.\n\nOther important info: reservations recommended, reservations require credit card hold (they don't charge anything, but will ask for # and expiration date), patio seating is first-come-first-serve (no exception), interior is nice with high vaulted ceilings, and utensils were pretty dirty (boo!)."

Located inside/outside of Paris it has a prime location on the strip (pun intended)!  \n\nThe food is always solid. I've had the escargot which was so flavorful!  (be careful, its hot!).  The prime rib I had here the first time is still one of the best.  Last time I went I had the steak and frites.  Steak was nice and tender, beaten flat! Frites were nice and flat, making them crispy!!!  I've also had the brunch here, which was pretty good as well.\n\nThe outdoor patio is amazing.  Right across from the Bellagio pool!  Great place for an evening dinner and people watching.  It's a bit dark inside, but that's expected of a steakhouse.   \n\nIn the past the service has been solid, but when I went a couple of weeks ago, I had a strange experience.  The hosts were awesome, getting us a nice seat on the patio, but our waiter was awkward.  In the middle of telling us our specials, he pauses, looks over at the other table and excuses himself.  He comes back about a minute later and says he had to take care of something.  After telling us our specials, just looks at us and then walks away.  Didn't ask any questions, ask if we had questions, or even concluded it in any normal way...just walked away.  He also seemed to be a little too busy for us. Granted it was my friend and I and we were pretty low maintenance.  At the end of the meal, he just drops off the check.  \n\nWith that one exception, my experiences here have been awesome, and I highly recommend it!"

  "text" : "I've always passed by Mon Ami Gabi, thinking it was one of the more tourist-trappy restaurants on the strip.  I assumed they were serving sub-par food for astronomical prices just because you had a front patio view of the strip.\n\nLet me say it here and now: I stand corrected.  At Mon Ami Gabi, I had the best Quiche Lorraine of my life.  The worst part?  I hadn't even ordered it.  It was my aunt's order and I had to just hope and pray that her tiny appetite would perform as normal and there would be lots left over for me to devour. \n\nStrangely enough, even the red cabbage-frisee-kale salad with the house dressing that came with the Quiche Lorraine was outstanding as well, to the point that I asked the staff if I could have the recipe for the house vinaigrette (and I don't even normally go for kale).\n\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict and, truthfully, they weren't the best I've ever had, but they weren't bad by any standard.  What can I say?  I had that quiche on the brain and nothing compared.\n\nThe atmosphere is as you would expect facing the strip, however if you happen to have your back to the strip, you might--just might--forget you're in Vegas and think you're sitting in a Paris bistro.  Until you see the hungover frat boys plop down at the table next to you and an overweight couple in visors and fanny-packs plop down at the table on the other side of you.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful for the most part, and when I asked for the recipe for the vinaigrette, they came back from the kitchen with a little form asking for my name, email address, and what recipe I wanted (I threw in a request for the quiche while I was at it) and the chef would email me soon.\n\nOverall, I can't wait to go back, maybe for something else (the blueberry waffles looked amazing), but probably for the quiche!"

Being from Hawaii, it was no big deal to me.\nShort story long, we were stuck in Vegas for 5 days, tears rolling down my face, my husband took me to the \"Eifel Tower\" restaurant on the strip called Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nWe were so lucky, we got a cute 2 top table right outside facing the Bellagio.\n It was one of the most romantic, outdoor dinners we had, it was almost like being there in Paris (ALMOST) Our waiter was amazing, as he listened to our sob story, and gave us excellent suggestions. \nWe ordered Fresh Oysters on a half shell,(totally devine) which is flown in daily, French Oniopn Soup (duh!) baked to perfection, Bread and Brie cheese with French Red wine (okay, so I got carried away a little with the French theme),Filet Mignon and sat right underneath the Eifel Tower.\nNext thing we know, the watershow from the Bellagio started! What timing, it was incredible.

I ordered the corned beef hash and a latte, and my sweetie ordered the traditional eggs benedict. The hash was awesome!

In fact, I think I may have to stay at Paris next time I go just so I can roll out of bed and into that restaurant.\n\nI had the french toast the first day and a ham and cheese omelette the next.  My honey had steak & eggs the first day, and french toast the next.  (I stole a bite of his steak so can comment on all three dishes).  Everything was really good.  \n\nThe french toast was different than your usual american french toast but was delicious, I love the generous dollop of whipped cream and all the blueberries and blueberry syrup.  They use two thick slices of bread, I am not sure what kind of bread but it's not your typical french toast sourdough or texas toast.  It was neither soggy or hard, was perfectly 'egged', and just the right amount of food to be comfortably sated without being stuffed.\n\nThe steak on my honey's steak and eggs was peppery and flavorful.  Sometime I need to come back for lunch so I can order the steak with roquefort sauce....mmmm!\n\nMy omelette was perfect as well - not greasy, but fluffy, with ham and gruyere.  The hash browns were perfect, buttery and herbed without being greasy, hard or soggy.  I loved the whipped butter and fresh raspberry jam that came with the crusty bread as well.  \n\nAnd to top it all off, the prices are not bad by Vegas standards.  Most of these dishes were about $11 (except the steak and eggs, which was a bit higher).  Let me tell you I've had FAR crappier breakfast for much more money many times in this town (both on the strip and off).\n\nService was very good, as a tip I'd suggest eating inside rather than outside, it's quieter and easier to get a table and it's not 100+ degrees.  Win-win!\n\nFor all these benefits, I give them the coveted 5 star rating.  It would be nice if they gave out total reward points, but they are apparently separate from the casino.  Oh well, no biggie!"

We got there around 7:00 and had no problem getting a table. Now, the food was pretty good and I'll get to that in a second. But first we need to address why this place doesn't get 5 stars. It has to do with the fact that we had 3 different servers who were kind of difficult to track down. I know, it's nit-picky, but our first server whispered in a thick french accent, our second server wasn't sure what the first had told us or taken as an order, and the third didn't speak at all. \n\nBeyond that, however, the food was tres magnifique! (Apologies to francophiles if I misspelled any of that...) We started with the baked goat cheese which came with a stunning crispy yet soft herb bread. Then, shocker of all evening, my \"burger and fries\" boyfriend ordered a steak, and ordered it medium rare! (We're talking about a \"everything should be well-done thank you very much,\" kind of guy here, so you should be shocked, too!) He got the steak roquefort  (bleu cheese sauce) and ate pretty much the whole thing. I ordered the Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onions red wine reduction) and ate pretty much all of it. (Ok, you caught me. I ate the whole thing. It was tasty. And I regret nothing.)\n\nIn addition, there are two other noteworthy items: 1) St. Germain +champagne cocktails = baaaannnnggggiiiinnng; 2) while there were multiple servers working our table, not one of them made an attempt to rush out. We got to linger over every course which, again, was freaking wonderful after rush rush travel travel we had endured for the last 24 hrs. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this little spot in Paris Las Vegas.   \n\nAnd seriously, get the St. Germain-tasty-nectar-of-the-gods-in-a-very-formal-french-way cocktail. You'll love it. I think. Or you should. Whatever, just try the steak ok? I know you won't regret that."

With our mix of celebrity chefs and other vittle visionaries, we've become a dining destination.  \n\nRather than holding tightly to their treasured recipes, some of these chefs are throwing open the doors to their kitchens and teaching us to cook like they do.  The classes are terrifically good time, and I have actually learned a lot each time I've attended.  It's a wonderful way to spend a Saturday morning.\n\nYou may want to have a designated driver on standby, though, because your wine glass will never be empty!\n\nHere are \"quelque choses\" I learned at a fantastic Mon Ami Gabi French cooking class in January of 2012:\n\n* When caramelizing mushrooms, don't wash them because they won't carmelize properly. Instead, brush them off. And, use pomace oil, rather than extra virgin olive oil, because it has a higher heating point. \n\n* The fine mesh sieve is a Chinois.  It's used to strain the Four Mushroom Soup after it's been blended. It's so-named because it resembles a Chinaman's hat. :)\n\n* Sear the sea scallops only on one side to avoid making them rubbery.\n\n* Don't pair a dessert wine with dessert. It's too much sweet, and they will diminish each other.\n\n* Preparing the fresh cream to top the Warm Chocolate Pudding Cake, I learned the proper way to whip is with a Figure 8 maneuver.  It's a workout!\n\nThe next class at Mon Ami Gabi is July 21.  Taking no chances, I registered a month ago.  It's gonna be \"magnifique\"!"

  "text" : "Me and cousin were deciding on a place to eat. There are so many fine restaurants in Vegas and in the end we decided last minute to go here on the 2nd night I was in Vegas. It was a great choice!!  I called in earlier that evening around 830pm and made reservations for two. I was very surprised that they still accepted reservations the night of! It was definitely a good idea since there were people waiting when we got there at 10pm. One of the Asian hostesses was a bit rude towards me since she asked me to get in the back of the line when I was obviously there before other guests. But I just let that go. \n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant it was very crowded. Most, if not all of the tables were occupied. I was under the impression that it was casual atire, but people were dressed rather nice. We sat indoors. The ambiance is rather romantic with slightly dim lights. The atmosphere seemed lively yet relaxed at the same time with people conversing and having a merry time. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us advice on what to order which worked out wonderfully!!\n\nWe ordered the ESCARGOTS DE BOURGOGNE(oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) and FILET MIGNON MERLOT(steak with butter and red wine reduction, served with their signature hand-cut frites). Both were very good. I've had snails before but never cooked this way. We ate it with the fresh warm bread! The steak was soooo TENDER!!! By far the best steak I have eaten! Seasoned perfectly and it is like butter when you cut into it. The Frites were also very good and a different spin on fries. I actually like it better than fries because they are thinner and crispier. I am sad that I decided not to order dessert here because I wanted to try Serendipity(no bueno). The total came out to be only $50. What a great deal for such delicious food! I will be coming back no doubt when I am in Vegas :)"

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi was the place we selected for brunch on Easter Sunday.\n\nI absolutely must say thank you to the hostess who held our table for us when we called to say we would be late due to the valet being full. I had no clue that valet could be full but apparently, that's a thing that can happen. Anyway, we were fifteen minutes late and they still held our table for us. That's pretty darned awesome!\n\nOur table was at the window line looking out onto the Bellagio fountains. It was a holiday and so there was a large show every thirty minutes and minor shows every fifteen. So we were able to watch eight different water shows during our two hour brunch. Yes, we are the grazers that drink and eat slowly and enjoy our time. I'd say I'm sorry but it would be untrue.\n\nOur only issue with Mon Ami Gabi, the food was forgettable. I cannot for the life of me remember what I had. I think I had French Toast but I could be wrong about that. Regardless, at those prices I'd like to at least remember what I had (outside of the coffee and mimosas).\n\nAnyway, overall this place was great for a mid morning spent watching people, water shows, and enjoying our friends and their company."

  "text" : "Biggest let down of the trip. I read Craig R's review earlier this year and decided the next time I visited Vegas I would eat here for breakfast and have the Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict. Thursday morning we all rose early so we could beat any crowds and have a delicious breakfast.\n\nSeated on the patio, handed menus, gave our drink orders. Looked over the menu...where is the Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict? I asked the waitress...oh, that is a winter item. The menu changes with the seasons. She said the menu is always updated online, so check it out before visiting again to make sure they have what I want.\n\nOh well. I ordered the normal Eggs Benedict. BF ordered the Croissant Sandwich, and BFF ordered Three Eggs with Bacon and Toast. \n\nThe food was great! My eggs benedict was one of the best ones I have ever had. I loved everything about it. BF's sandwich was awesome! It had eggs, tomato, turkey, avocado and mayo. Delish!\n\nOur service was spectacular and I really liked the look of this restaurant. I will definitely eat here again, and now it looks like I have a reason to visit Las Vegas in the winter!"

  "text" : "It was a sad walk from the Cosmo to here since it was our last day on our trip. It ended up being the best breakfast as well. \n\nCame in on Thursday morning around 10AM without a reservation. The hostess greeted us and asked if we wanted to wait for an outside patio table or dine in. We didn't have extra time to spare so we opted to dine inside. The wait was only a few minutes and we were led to a quint table that is inside the restaurant but also can be considered outside since it was next to the huge open area that had a nice breeze and view of the strip. \n\nAfter looking over their large brunch menu I ordered the fruit basket and the turkey and egg white omelette. The fruit basket was half of a cantaloupe cut to look like a flower with mango, pineapple, strawberries, grapes and berries inside. It was almost too pretty to eat. It also came with brown sugar, yogurt and a clear sweet syrup on the side. The fruit was all fresh sweet and ripe. The omelette was a nice size portion with tomatoes and avocado ontop. It was a little bland but the hot sauce I asked for spiced it up. I am not a hash browns fan but theirs are very good with grilled onions through out. \n\nService was okay. Our waitress wasn't the warm and inviting type but got the job done. We did have a couple of times that we had to wait for the coffee and water to be refilled. \n\nThe decor and layout reminded us of the cafes we had dined at when we were in Europe so Mon Ami Gabi did that correct. \n\nPrices is great for the quantity and quality of the food. Too bad we didn't dine here sooner otherwise we wouldnt have wasted our time nor money on the other two restaurants. But I will remember this restaurant for our next trip. For the fruit, two entrees, coffee, tax and tip the total came out around $52.00. \n\nMisc. info: reservations can only be made for inside the restaurant. The outside patio seating is first come first served."

The hostesses are always warm and friendly as they chat with you on the way to your requested table. I initially visited this restaurant for it's dinner menu which is extensive and very tasty, but it has quickly become my favorite breakfast spot while in Vegas.\n\nThere's nothing more relaxing than sitting on the patio in the morning enjoying a steak and eggs breakfast with some delicious strong coffee, (and a morning bellini). Both times this year, (May 14 (Nicole R.) and May 21 (Rey R.)) the service was impeccable. Both of the waitress were very friendly and were always available if we needed anything. I would absolutely recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone looking for good food and good service."

I tried their beef dip with fries and was not disappointed. i should have tried their famous steak special as I later found out it was to die for. The restaurant is usually busy and conveniently located across from the Bellagio hotel, where you might just catch the water fountain show in front of the hotel. I certainly look forward to returning to this gem of a place."

  "text" : "Vegas! A place to play, eat, and spend lot of money. Been to Vegas many times and have done it all, but now in my old age, I look forward to the food options.\nVisited this French restaurant about 10 years ago, and this time I took my boyfriend.\nIt was HOT!!! but managed to get a table in the shade, under the umbrellas and the mist that sprays from the railing. This is a great spot for people watching!!!\nWe had good service. The gal that sat us was very chatty. Our service, a nice young man, not overly friendly but efficient.\nI ordered what I ordered when I came many moons ago, full size order of muscles, with came with thin frites. We also ordered the warm brie with honey, and a fruit bowl, which was a carved cantaloupe filled with fruit.\nThe warm brie with honey came with roasted garlic pieces, whole hazelnuts, and 4 crustini. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of brie, but he certainly loved this! He also liked the fries. His fruit was good, and the fresh bread, mini loaf they give you, is freshly baked on the premises and is so good. \nSo if you can't make it to gay paris, this may be the closest you can come. Of course they aren't as snobby as the french can be (so I've heard). If you are a french foodie snob and have been to Paris, or France, maybe not your cup of tea, but for the rest of this, will do.  Pricey yes, but well worth the money."

  "text" : "Picturesque little cafe that gives you great views of the Bellagio fountains if you are sitting outside.  I had quite possibly the most elegant corned beef hash I've ever had.  Coming from a childhood of eating the canned, Hormel bits o'beef and potato, this dish was quite remarkable.  There was a nicely seasoned, tender corned beef brisket on the bottom of the dish, with 2 perfectly poached eggs on top.  A crispy plate of hash browns was served on the side, and it also came with some fresh baguette-style toast.  It tasted quite good, however, the menu stated that it should have come with roasted red pepper.  After searching on my plate, I found the tiniest sliver of red pepper on the dish.  They are really cutting corners here (jk)!\n\nCoffee was refilled promptly, as was water.  One thing to note is even though they are part of the Paris casino, they aren't actually owned by Harrah's, so you cannot get any Total Rewards discounts, nor pay for your meal in Total Rewards points."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is the kind of French Bistro friend we all wish we knew back in our own hometowns.\n\nFor me, the number one draw was the View ... not the view of the Paris Hotel & Casino, but the view from the outdoor patio of the Bellagio Fountains across the Las Vegas Strip. There are two dining options at Mon Ami Gabi: Indoor or Patio. Indoors is going to be a \"finer dining experience\" and much shorter wait. Even though we had reservations, it took about 20 minutes to get seated on the patio. The wait was worth it. We lucked into a table right in the middle directly across from the Bellagio. If you come after 6:00 p.m. the fountain show is every 15 minutes, so, plan accordingly.\n\nOur meal was $195 for my wife and me. It was a bit over-priced, but still a rewarding couple steaks, drinks, and sides. And did I mention the view? Olivia had the 22 oz Bone-In Rib Eye Steak with Bearnaise Sauce ($40) while I got the Filet Mignon Merlot with Butter & Wine Reduction Sauce ($35). Both steaks were 4-star cuts of meat with the filet tender and the rib eye juicy. They came with the house Frites and we added sides of Asparagus (3-stars) and Mushrooms (3-stars).\n\nI stuck with the house Pinot Noir (Mon Ami Gabi 09 $8 each) before/during dinner while she went with 3 rounds of the Le Fleur cocktail ($13)  which was super sweet thanks to St. Germain and Bacardi Limon. For dessert, we split a Creme Brulee ($8 - 4 stars) and had a Latte. We were in no rush to leave thanks to the Fountains of Bellagio view and relaxed pace of our meal.\n\nOur server was especially bland. I'm sure his job must suck serving tourists all day, every day, but a little enthusiasm or acting like you cared about our experience would of been nice. Oh, who cares. Just bring us another round of drinks.\n\nAnyhoo, come for the view. Enjoy some steaks. Dream of being in Paris. You're on vacation at Mon Ami Gabi."

  "text" : "One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, because of it's fantastic patio seating and views of the water show at the Bellagio. I've always got reservations here every time I visit Vegas, twice a year, or so.\n\nI had my first escargot experience here and it was pretty tasty. I'd definitely try it again. Their warm breads are pretty yummy, too. While their steak entrees are decently done (not too much of a fan of the potato strings, aka fries, that overload the plate), they have an immaculate French onion soup, with ooey gooey cheese bubbling all over the cup and then, there's this dessert...\n\nThanksgiving of 2011, my family and I ordered off a special Thanksgiving menu they had created for the holiday weekend. They had a pumpkin bread pudding (and I'd never had bread pudding before), which I tried, and literally stood up out of my seat. It was THE SINGLE MOST BEST DESSERT I've ever had in MY LIFE. If that thing was on the regular menu, I'd be in Vegas monthly, or shipping it to my home in LA. So if you're there during Thanksgiving and see that very special menu item--ORDER it!"

  "text" : "I think this has become my new favourite spot to eat in Vegas. From start to finish, the whole experience was 5 stars!\n\nI had made a reservation for 9pm, and we were advised that if we wanted a table outside (which we did) that there may be a wait. So we headed to the Paris about 40 minutes before our reservation time. I spoke to hostess and requested a table on the patio, and asked if we could try to get a table fairly up front and centered, so we'd have a good view of the Bellagio and the fountains. She said she would do her best. Half an hour later, we were being shown to our table by an incredibly friendly hostess who made conversation, and didn't just take us to our table like sheep. \n\nOur table was perfect! Right up front and dead center. We were able to people watch, and the fountains at the Bellagio really helped set the scene for a romantic dinner on our last night in Vegas. \n\nOur server was attentive, but not overly so. Knew the menu, knew the specials, and was able to make recommendations. Friendly but not in your face. Efficient but not cold. \n\nThe food was perfect. We started with the onion soup and warm brie, both were gone within minutes. Be forewarned, however... the onion soup is not the onion soup you find at your average American restaurant. A nice big crouton, plenty of melted cheese, and that slight sweetness that you should have in a good onion soup. The brie was ridiculously good. Melted and gooey, drizzled with a peppered honey, and whole cloves of roasted garlic. The baguette they bring you to start is warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and the butter is soft and spreadable (HUGE brownie points for that!). \n\nWe both went for the steak frittes: my partner getting the steak au poivre, with the peppered sauce, and I ended up getting the bourdelaise and the bernaise sauce on the side, because I couldn't decide which I wanted. Both were amazing, but I ended up pouring the light, slightly lemony bernaise on to my steak, which was perfectly rare and melt-in-your-mouth tender. The frittes were thin and cooked perfectly. We shared a side of ratatouille, that had incredible flavour and complemented the steaks perfectly. \n\nA perfect end to our trip."

We love the service and the food, the food especially!\n\nOur most favorite starting appetizer is definitely the scallops. I'm really picky on my scallops and Mon Ami Gabi gets it just right. If I would order about five plates of scallops for appetizer, main course and dessert I really would! It comes in three cute little seashell molds and each one has two perfectly plump scallops hiding under a nice layer of cheese (I normally remove to save myself the added calories) and after a nice sprinkling of lemon juice, dive in! It came to the point we have to get our own portions because it's so good. Definitely a must try.\n\nI've had the bass (which was a special menu item, I believe) and the salmon (a regular menu item), and of the two the salmon is delicious! It's flaky and moist and it's just the right portion. \n\nThe apple tarte...   What more can I say about this warm and cold and sweet luscious dessert. Well, we devoured it. Plain and simple. It was a nice ending to our meal. \n\nThe only thing that kinda bothers me, is the seating. We were seated in the midst of groups and groups of people the last time we were here. On Valentine's day, however, we had a nice intimate two seat table away from every one else. That was nice. I would love it if we could get that kind of seating all the time, but availability gets in the way unfortunately.\n\nOther than that, I highly recommend coming here if you like French food, or just food in general. Much, much better than the Eiffel Tower Restaurant-- by a lot!\n\nOn a side note, they also serve breakfast; which I am DYING to try!"

He did some Yelp research while I did some primping in our sweet Penthouse bathroom at Mandalay (see that review for how we got a Penthouse), He chose Mon Ami Gabi and made a reservation through Open Table.\n\nWe journeyed down the strip to Paris and found the restaurant right away (it's right next to the main entrance off the Strip). First impressions: kind of dark but elegant looking. With out late reservation, we weren't able to get patio seating, but we didn't have to wait too long. We got a few quick pulls off the slots before we were seated.\n\nOur table was in between two larger tables, with not much room in between. Reminds me of the close proximity of the tables at the Brewpub I worked at for many years. Kind of surprising with the \"fanciness\" of the place to be shoved into some little two top between two large tables. Not at all romantic. Not long after we sat down, a raucous group sat to the right of us and then an oddly quiet family of four sat to our left (you've seen them: they don't talk unless it's to the server...so weird).\n\nOur server was French, and extremely good at his job - although he had absolutely no sense of humor or personality. Maybe that's an American thing? To have a personilty? Not sure. The close proximity of the tables made his dignified shimmy between them borderline hilarious.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and steaks. Everything was good. The steak wasn't outstanding, but it was still delicious. Expect Vegas prices!\n\nOverall, a great way to start the Vegas trip. I would suggest getting a patio table or request more private seating if you are looking for the romance of France."

  "text" : "By far my best dining experience in Vegas, actually in a while. They definitely deserve all 5 stars for the service, food, appearance and everything.\n\nService:\nWe came here without reservations and were told we had an 1 and 30 minute wait so we figured we would walk around and catch the Fountains at Bellagio show. The hostess then told us to come back after 30 minutes and she would give us a buzzer. We see the show and come back only to have to wait for just 3 minutes. We asked them to sit us on the balcony and with only a side balcony table being opened they let us wait for the center table to to be cleaned without any issue! Our waitress had a very cheery attitude and recommended us dishes to try.\n\nFood:\nWe started of with Duck confit and spinach with cranberries on the side and OMGoodness it was to die for! Like seriously the duck melted in my mouth! I ordered the steak with the caramelized onions and hand carved french fries and my bf had the seafood special. The food was well cooked and very filling.\n\nI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi for a nice dinner and will be back for more duck confit!"

  "text" : "I love this restaurant! We went during the week so we didn't have to worry about long waits. We made a reservation anyway and got to sit at an awesome table facing the Bellagio fountains. \n\nService was great--our server had a super thick french accent which could be difficult to understand, but at least he wasn't snobby in the least. \n\nOur order:\nDrink: Frangria 3 STARS. (sangria with rosemary) - rosemary was overwhelming, and the drink was incredibly sweet. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again.\n\nAppetizers:\nCountry Pate: 5 STARS. I love pate. country pate, classic, terrines of all sorts. This one had a nice meaty texture to it, and I loved the bread and mustard it was served with. Would definitely order this again. They also have a chicken liver mousse on the menu that I want to try. Next time!\n\nMixed salad with kale: 4 STARS. Can't remember too much about this salad, but it was good, from what I can recall.\n\nMussels Mariniere (boyfriend's order): 5 STARS. The rest of the trip, we were talking about coming back to get more of these mussels!!! We ordered a half-order for $10.95 and they were big, tender, and that broth was AMAZING and perfectly seasoned. Best dish of the meal for sure! ***TIP: The resto gives you a loaf of bread at the beginning of the meal. SAVE IT FOR SOPPING UP THE BROTH. Too good.\n\nBone-in Ribeye: 4 STARS: Perfectly seasoned and very well cooked, but excessively fatty (not marbled--we're talking chunks of fat). I also had a bit of gristle in mine but it wasn't much. The fries that come with the rib eye are SO GOOD. It's like a potato chip made babies with a french fry. crispy and tasty and awesome and they soak up the meat juice and become little crispy meat-juice carriers. My mouth is watering at the thought of it.\n\nScallops with Ratatouille (boyfriend's order): 4 STARS. The scallops (order came with 4 or 5 large scallops) were perfectly cooked--tender and flavorful. The basil pairing was perfect. The ratatouiile was just okay according to him. Plate portion was on the smaller side, but the awesomeness of the scallops made that okay for him.\n\nWe will definitely be back, especially for the pate and mussels. For the price and ambiance (especially if you can get a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains), it can't be beat!"

Maybe we just didn't order the right things, but my bf and I weren't that impressed.\n\nWe came for brunch and ordered the Quiche Lorraine and the Corned Beef Hash. The quiche was cooked well, but it was too much of one thing and I couldn't finish it. I was expecting several small pieces of crispy bacon, but ended up with some big chunks of fat. I didn't try the corned beef hash, but my bf said it didn't taste the way he expected.\n\nService was okay. Our waiter didn't check on us quite enough, but did his job. I expected a nicer atmosphere, but for some reason it didn't seem that nice. The place seemed too cramped and busy. Maybe it would've been different if we sat outside with a view of the Bellagio fountain.\n\nOverall, I wasn't that impressed by this place, but I'm willing to come back again to try out other dishes."

The man dishing out the water was quick to refill, which was great as it was over 100 degrees the night we were there.  The waitress was trying to speak with a french accent, which got to be a little funny after a while.  Every once in a while she would forget altogether, which made it even funnier when she would go back to it.   We went on a Monday night around 8:30 and maybe only had a 10 min wait to sit on the patio.  Would have liked to try it for breakfast, but never got up that early.  Would go back"

The indoor dining can be pleasant and, if you're fortunate, you might even get views of the Bellagio fountains from inside.  The plus side of indoor dining is you can get a reservation. When the weather allows, the patio dining is the best but the wait can be long.\n\nThe food is quite good and certainly adequate for the venue, but what makes this place is the setting and views.  We have had many items including fish, burgers, and steak.  Service has always been pleasant, attentive, and unassuming."

This was one of my \"affordable\" culinary trips and a good way to end my trip. \n\nThe meal began with a warm baguette brought to the table in a paper bag. Soft and warm and very comforting. \n\nI ordered the cold pea soup as a starter. Small chunks of vegetables, creme fraiche, swimming in a pool of a bright green pool of soup. Simply delicious. \n\nI had the skate wing for my main dish. My biggest concern was if I'd spend the rest of the meal picking out bones between bites. Crispy and brown on top and a nice flaky interior without the bones, seasoned with salt. It sat in a purée of roasted cauliflower, which was creamy and almost had a potato-like quality."

But after a night in Vegas, we started off a tad bit late and wound up giving Mon Ami Gabi a go for lunch. \n\nSo, the drinking never stops in Vegas right? Okay, maybe those are words spoken by a borderline alcohol connoisseur, my group order a cask of Sangria, super yummy I might add and perfect pairing to the lunch that followed.\n\nMy order consisted of the Warm Chicken & Brie sandwich that comes with hand-cut frites. I absolutely love caramelized onions so that was the first thing about this sandwich entree that caught my eye and my taste buds. I had been leery of the idea of there also being green apple on it as well, but to my surprise it paired well (I am obviously not well versed in pairing of foods, but I sure do love to eat them when they jive and put a smile on my face and a flutter in my belly).\n\nThe service was excellent, our waiter always paid close attention to our table and was always right on queue when we were just about to pour our own refill of Sangria, quickly rushing over to take care of the small task for us. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, and hope to come back and visit them for breakfast next time I'm in town."

Very attentive, friendly, and professional staff.  Add to that a priceless view overlooking the Bellagio and fountains.   Main dining room is elegant, however go the distance and wait for seating in the pavilion to get the view that puts your romantic evening over the top.  Understand the place is a buzz with energy, so expect volume and chatter to go hand in hand with that.  It's not a quiet place, but you will be able to hear and hold conversation.    Strongly advise advance reservations."

  "text" : "Always loved the Chicago original, and nice to say they do a great job here, too. The food and drink and execution in the pretty bistro made for a couple nice occasions. Pre-show, had the Country Pate along with the Frites with some wine and champagne. Near enough to the theatre, we lounged for a half hour at the bar, had some witty banter with the bartender and enjoyed ourselves. The Pate hit the spot -- served with delicious mustard atop, with toast points, olives, cocktail onions etc. \n\nThe Frites are, in fact, Flat! But very tasty -- not oily at all, and perfectly crisp. It took maybe 28 seconds for them to appear after ordered. Mmmmm.\n\nThe next day, we returned for a light breakfast. Intelligentsia Coffee, so nice to see you. And the Market Berry Waffle worked great for me. Fresh berries alongside the crisp on the outside, soft on the inside waffles. I asked for the Whipped Cream on the side so I could monitor my indulgence! The real syrup was a nice component as well. I ordered a side of Poached Eggs, too, which helped fill me up more completely. The Bircher Muesli was outstanding -- and apparently not easy to make. If you're so inclined, go for it. The mimosa was a nice reminder of having a lazy Sunday. \n\nLoved also to sit inside but right near the outdoor deck. It's so airy and light out there; really the best of both worlds. And it's a marvel to occasionally see the tactical units circling round to insure the flow of traffic in and out works seamlessly."

We got seats right on the edge of the patio, so we could see the sidewalk and, across the street, the Bellagio. The fountains weren't running in the morning but it was still a nice view. And the people watching was excellent, as it is in Vegas! We had good service by our waiter, who brought things out quickly and was always nearby. I ordered steel cut oats, a bagel with cream cheese, and OJ. My friend got a breakfast crepe. She wasn't that impressed by it as she didn't like the sauce, but it wasn't bad. She said the coffee was amazing. My OJ was good, though small for the price. My oatmeal was great and so was the bagel. The oatmeal came with raisins, brown sugar, and half and half on the side, so I could make it up as I pleased. \n\nPrice was comparable to other breakfast places we tried in Vegas, and quality was good. The view made it all worth the while. I only wish I could've had lunch here and seen the fountains!"

At first, I thought we weren't going to get seats because the majority of the people here are waiting for the patio seats. (advice: come early to sit at the patio, worth the wait to enjoy yourself) Their brunch ranges from $5-$13. You must try their  quiche (oh Frenchy words), they are so fluffy and so darm goood!! The spinach/asparagus quiche I got was good. It woulf have been great if they had taken a bit off salt. \n\nSerivce: great! They refill your cup when they see you are out. They come around and asks 'if there's anything else I can get you?' Loved it.\n\nOh!!! so they have a full bar, Mimosas, and a bloody Mary bar for customers to customize their OWN Mary's! I thought that was awesome. They start you off with a tall glass, with a shot of vodka, and you go make your own bloody Marys. Made my trip even better\n\nWill I come back? most definitely!"

Patio seating on a first come, first serve basis, while you can reserve a table on OpenTable for the inside seating. \n\nAlthough I am generally not a duck fan, I went for Duck Config with Lentils. I must say, I was quite blown away, considering that I don't particularly like duck. The config was juicy, moist and fatty, and the duck was not gamey at all. The green lentils were refreshing and cooked perfectly. \n\nI also visited Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast. My brioche toast (a side order) was delicious and spinach and goat cheese omelette melted in mouth."

I was directed to this joint from a local friend who told me that this was probably the best value on the strip.  After eating here for like the third time I would say that she is correct.\n\nThe hottie and I went on a Sunday night and was surprised at how busy it was.  I started out with my usual french onion soup.  This is what french onion soup is about.  Not too salty but still rich in onion flavor.  I got the special of the day which was Beef Wellington.  The hottie decided to get a bowl of mussels.  First the mussels.  I can say, without a doubt, the BEST mussels I've ever had.  Mussels are usually overcooked so that they mussels shrivel up and are kinda chewy and rubbery.  Or somtimes they are gritty and sandy tasting.  These mussels were plump and juicy, exactly what mussels should be and on top of that the white wine sauce just hightened the flavor of the mussels.  Just awesome!  My beef wellington was also very good although the slice was a bit small considering I paid $36 for it.  \n\nOverall, just what I expected.  A quality meal at a very reasonable and affordable price."

  "text" : "Good food, great service, outstanding views! \n\nI've come here every time I've been to Vegas and have tried every possible meal from breakfast to a late dinner. The best time to enjoy Gabi's is at nighttime: the Bellagio fountains will be going off every 20 or so minutes, the Strip will be packed, and the patio cool and pleasant even in the summer months. However it can get crowded in the evening so if you want to sit outside be prepared to wait for 20 or so minutes and get a reservation in advance. I've come here with a friend once without reservations and was told there would be more than an hour wait to get a seat anywhere on a Saturday night. Since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:\nBreakfast: Croque Madame or the Quiche Lorraine. Help yourself to some champagne too, it's Vegas\nLunch: Chilled zapacho, Seafood Crepe, and the Trout Amandine are all great. On Friday they serve an Australian cod which is brilliant\nBrunch: Do yourself a favor and order a French 75. It's no longer on the menu but they make the best in town. Add in the Eggs Benedict and it'll rival Bouchon for the best French-themed brunch in Vegas.\nDinner: The Seafood Platter is the best deal for an appetizer. 50 dollars for a whole lobster, oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and even more. Follow that up with the Steak Bearnaise or Roquefort and finish up with profiteroles accompanied by cognac. Be careful: the calories will add up but it will have been well worth it."

So come early if you're a walk-in because you'll probably have a wait! But it is well worth the wait! The staff were so friendly and attentive, our water glasses were constantly full. The outdoor seating is fab, with a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. We didn't get starters but the choices looked delicious. I had the scallops with ratatouille, unbelievable! My mom had gabi's fish and frites which I tasted, it was also really good. My dad and brother had steaks which they said were really tasty and cooked as ordered. Regarding desserts, I tasted the sorbet, profiteroles and berry crumble. The first two were great, however I wouldn't recommend the crumble. Maybe it was just the one we got but it tasted like it had been near something in the fridge which had given it a funny taste.. The coffee was great as was the wine! Overall it was a great experience, i will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas!"

My bf and I took a dive in hopes it wouldn't been too long of a wait. Either we were lucky or we came at the right time, the waiting time wasn't long at all.\n\nFood is amazing and good.

Nine people who all love each other, have fun and wanted to eat nearly every meal together. With that, Vegas can be a challenge! \n\nWe spotted Mon Ami from the cab, did a quick yelp search - saw great reviews from James S, Alan K, and Randy B and knew they wouldn't lead me astray! After that I said a small prayer and called for reservations. Nine at 8:30, yes ma'am. The cabs on the strip parted and Celine Dion herself started singing!!\n\nAlas, my group tried every way possible to throw off Mon Ami, we called to tell them we were late, we all arrived separately, we had a baby in the group, 4 of us had to be out in time for a 10 pm showing of Jubilee...we laid it on!! Mon Ami responded with grace and a smile. \n\nEveryone had great food, heard wonderful things about the french onion soup, the trout, the salmon, the mussels and the salads. I personally had the roasted chicken with green beans and it was a plate of perfection. The beans had a nice snap, my chicken was moist (Lord I hate that word) and the skin was flavorful and crispy! \n\nI love this place and will be back! And yes, we made it just in time to catch the awesomeness that is Jubilee! Thank you Mon Ami Gabi!"

The chicken liver mousse is just divine! I also tried the gazpacho a friend had and found it perfect. For an entree I had the frisee salad with warm bacon and a poached egg on top. The entire dish was simply amazing, the egg perfectly poached and delish! My partner had the prime burger with brie, it was Cooked to perfection and tasty too.

REALLY? the only table outside with no umbrella in 110+ heat? we immediately asked to be moved inside. luckily, they were very nice and accommodating, they moved us right away to a table inside. \n\nif you're eating here you have to have their steak frites! yumm. a nice long thin cut of steak served with herb butter and crispy pomme frites. They also have other topping such as a red wine reduction with carmelized onion... or bleu cheese... droolll. \n\nSince it was brunch I figured I should do something... brunchy. So i also ordered the blueberry french toast. This was also amazing.. fresh blueberry on top with blueberry syrup and a generous dollup of fresh whipped cream. I didn't think it was overly sweet, but then again I was pairing it with a steak so I guess it balances out. \n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and extra accommodating. Everyone is very friendly. \n\nQuick tip: there is a dress code.. men no tanks! they do give you a plain tee to wear though if you do forget!"

We made last minute dinner reservations and were pleasantly surprised by the dark, Parisian bistro type atmosphere. \n\nComing with the breadbasket, they have a small dish of shaved carrot salad. I loved how different it was from the normal fare and enjoyed it immensely. \n\nAs an entree, I had the cold seafood platter. It was plentifully packed with 2 types of shrimp, oysters, and a whole lobster. The lobster was plump and did not lose its flavor. \n\nThe server introduced me to a great white wine. She didn't make me feel dumb for being a wine neophyte, which I liked. \n\nWe enjoyed our time at Mon Ami Gabi. As is in Paris, we sat relatively close to other patrons, but that added to the ambience\n(and aided in people watching)"

If you are feeling bold, I recommend trying the chicken liver spread.  Their bread pudding and chocolate puffs are amazing!!  The restaurant manager, Michael, was gracious enough to comp our appetizers and desserts.  For a group of 9 women, each of us paid on average $35, which included tip.  Our group sat inside and it was busy and packed with people.  Atmosphere was relaxed, but service was great."

At first my mom did not want to come here, but we were so hungry we settled for this place. I had the strawberry waffle with a side of bacon while my mom had a market berry waffle with a side of bacon. I love every single thing about my order. The presentation of the waffles was so nice. Rather than serving a whole waffle, the chefs cut it up and arrange it in a beautiful way. The whipped cream came on the side. The waffle was so light and crispy. The bacon was amazing! It was thick, yet crispy. And there was a sweetness to it. My mom loved the bacon as well saying \"I'd go there again just for the bacon!\" This place is a bit pricey, but it was well worth it. I wouldn't have gotten full off of the waffle alone, so that side of bacon was necessary. The staff is very attentive as well."

  "text" : "This place is really cute and all, but I did not leave dinner feeling impressed. The steak was talked up before we came here and reviews said it wasn't bad either. I've had my share of amazing steaks and this was SO disappointing. It was $35 for the filet mignon au poivre and I would much rather have spent my money elsewhere. I could have paid ten more dollars and gotten myself a fantastic steak elsewhere.\n\nI ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked okay. My biggest gripe: it was COVERED in sauce. All it said on the menu was that it came with creme fraiche (which it did) but it was swimming in sauce. It was so overpowering that it ruined the meal. Another girl at the table got the same thing and had the same feelings. Sauce was so overpowering. Good steaks don't really need anything other than a decent rub on the outside. I felt the meat was a bit low on flavor otherwise. You can sub the fries for mashed potatoes or another side for $1.95 more. \n\nThe sangria was good. They say it can serve 4, but really, it can serve 5. We also tried the chicken liver mousse. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall, it was a cute place, but that's pretty much it for me. It is on the cheaper side for Vegas considering the atmosphere, but if you are in the mood for steak, look elsewhere. That extra $10 will really get you something 100  times better. We also initially had reservations for 6, but had a last minute cancellation, and they still automatically added in the 18% gratuity that is for parties of 6 or more? Not cool.\n\nNote: Patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis. Reservations are only good for inside seating and your whole party must be present to be seated."

Wife had fresh berry pancake.  They are the thin large pancakes, not the traditional type.  They were lovely with a slight lemon taste to them with fresh berries and whipped cream.  Oldest daughter had the nutella waffle which was a disappointment, according to her.  She found them to be too hard and lacking enough nutella to actually classify them as nutella waffles.  Youngest daughter had what she called \"the most amazing french toast of her life.\"  I took a bite or three and would have to agree.  I had a ham, cheese and egg crepe and found it to be a delightful change of pace.   I've had breakfast here four or five times and have never been disappointed."

Situated directly across from the Bellagio Fountains, this restaurant offered a pleasant experience on a beautiful day, and we sat comfortably on the semi-outdoor patio despite the summer heat.\n\nThe Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine was excellent.  The buttery taste of the salmon and egg contrasted very nicely with the capers.  Never before have I actually enjoyed eating the capers, so I would say that this was a good sign.\n\nThe most notable dish ordered was the Seafood Crepe.  The seafood was amazingly fresh, a great feat for an inland barren desert, and it was all served in a rich, savory cream sauce which brought it all together.\n\nTo top it off, we had a Strawberry and Lemon Sorbet, made from scratch.  The sweet berry naturally went well with the citrus, and it was a wonderful way to finish our lunch.\n\nMoreover, our waitress was attending culinary school to become a chef, so she really knew her stuff, not to mention the service was great."

Considering we were going to be at the pool all day, I didn't mind sitting inside.\n\nEverything on the menu looked so delicious. I decided to get the French Toast with a side of crispy bacon. The French Toast was topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup, and fresh whipped cream. It was sooo delicious! The portions were pretty big, so I gave the other piece to my husband. He agreed that I ordered the better dish. He was trying to be all healthy and what not by getting the Turkey & Egg White Omelette. Lesson learned.

  "text" : "One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas because the quality and type of food they serve is comparable to what I ate when I went to Paris. I like their escargot - garlicky and simple, cooked the correct way as the French would.  Great steak frites - I like mine cooked medium rare.  It is a thin piece of steak and it's buttery and comes with frites which are very crispy (please don't ask for steak sauce!!!).  Warm Brie cheese - creamy and is perfect with their warm baguette. Croque Monsieur - the presentation is a bit different.  Instead of egg or melted cheese on top, theirs is cheese on top but it's not melted and the whole sandwich itself is lacking creaminess and it comes with frites as well but it's quite alright. \n\nYou can't go to a French restaurant without having chocolate mousse and profiteroles.  The chocolate mousse is semi-sweet so it's bitter and a bit sweet - the perfect chocolate!  It's smooth as silk and melts in your mouth.  You have to trust this chocoholic!  The profiteroles are cream puffs with vanilla ice cream drizzled in chocolate fudge sauce.  That's a pretty graphic description so I don't think an explanation is necessary.\n\nThey're always and I mean ALWAYS busy.  Be smart and reserve a table at least 24 hours ahead.  Their patio has an excellent view of Bellagio's fountain show.  Think date night.\n\nService has been consistently good no matter how busy they are.  I always leave Mon Ami happy."

From the moment we were seated, our server with the most welcoming smile, made sure we were tended to throughout the evening.\n\nTo start, we had a complimentary rice/pea salad along with their bread and butter. For apps, we tried their escargot which was utterly garlicky and delicious. Don't forget to use the little bread you have left to dip it into the left over sauce after eating the escargot. I think this came with six pieces.\n\nI got their steak bernaise. The cut of this steak is thin but it is surprisingly filling. This steak came with a bernaise sauce that you can't stop dipping it in. Each of their steaks come with frites. They were unlike any frites I have ever had... very thinly cut... a cross between hash browns and the end pieces of McDonald's fries. I can't say I was wild for them, but if you like crunch, these will certainly hit the spot. I also got an order of their mac and cheese which was a decent portion for a side. It was a little TOO cheesy for my taste but then again, I was starting to come down with a sore throat so that could be it.\n\nI will definitely plan a visit here again next time I'm in Vegas!"

I've been here so many times but here's what I remember from my most recent trip:\n\nFrench Toast = AWSOME! They have some of the best french toast around.  They used to have more flavors like bananas foster but now it's just blueberry but still great!\n\nChicken Brie and Apple crepe = Awesome! Yep this was also a winner. Their cream sauce is delicious and the crepe is so soft and flavorful. Great combination of flavors!\n\nCorned Beef Hash = Mmmm! Yep this was also delicious!  They had big flakes of corned beef and flavored it to perfection.\n\nSalmon and Quinoa = Yumm!  Again, delicious.  However, my mom doesn't like farm raised salmon but they said they get more consistent quality with farm raised over wild.

However, it is an overall solid restaurant on the Vegas strip that will get you good food for a relatively good price with a great view.  \n\nWe made a reservation beforehand easily on OpenTable and seated pretty quickly.  Service was relatively friendly (note you're going to need a shirt and shoes I believe) although it took a while for the food to come out interestingly enough.  \n\nMake sure to try to either get a patio seat or if it's too hot, the room right by the patio that will still give you an open view of the Bellagio across the street.  This room not only will keep you very cool but you'll get a great sight of the awesome Bellagio fountains while you're eating without having to stand and watch.  \n\nFood-wise, they have a brunch menu that is relatively cheap along with a regular menu filled with a lot of different items from crepes to steaks (it can get pricey depending on what you get).  I had the seafood crepe for about $16 and although it wasn't the best crepe I've ever had, the sauce and the fresh-tasting shrimps/scallops were solid along with a cranberry juice (they had a full drink bar/menu of a lot of items).  \n\nSo again, if you're in Vegas and want a solid, consistent place with a great view, you can't really go too wrong with Mon Ami Gabi."

I don't have many comments on the restaurant itself other than it's nice to sit outside with the light water spray (?) to keep you cool. \n\nI ordered the Seafood Crepe. If you like seafood, you can't go wrong with this dish!! SO DELICIOUS. Probably the best crepe I've ever had. The crepe is filled with a white seafood wine cream (i made that up, but that's what it tasted like to me!) with green peas and topped with jumbo shrimp and scallop. You might find it a little salty, but I like salty so no problems there! It's so filling! But I finished it because my mouth just couldn't stop..\n\nI also ordered the frites since everyone kept raving about them. If you know me, then you know I have this unhealthy (really unhealthy) relationship with fries. I LOVE FRIES. And I didn't like theres. I'm usually the one to say I always like the crappy ends of the fries, like the fries you find at the bottom of the basket, but this was a literally a basket full of it. It was like thin potato skins really. Meh, I like thin but I still need some potato! \n\nStill, I cannot wait to go back to try the rest of the menu!!"

Unfortunately, this time was not as great and this rating is solely on this weekend's experience. \n\nService was horrendous and that was probably b/c we got a crappy waitress. She was not around when we needed her to fill waters, ask for extra plates, and check up on us.  She was very pushy for us to order dessert and throughout the whole time did not really smile and was not friendly. \n\nWhile some people enjoyed their meals, one of my friends ordered salmon and though cooked correctly, the quality was not great.  In addition, I ordered my filet medium and it came out medium well and dried.  I found myself chewing on the steak when really it should melt in my mouth. \n\nI may come here again because this was the first time of 20 times that things did not fare well.

  "text" : "A French inspired \"steakhouse\" right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. We celebrated a birthday meal here looking for something a little different than your typical Vegas restaurant/buffet. It was an enjoyable meal, although not all that memorable.\n\nWe sat down after a long day of traveling and adjusting to the desert heat of Vegas in August and were all pretty famished. Only problem is, after sitting and staring at the menu for probably a good half hour, nobody could decide what sounded good. We couldn't even figure out what we wanted to drink! It's not that the menu didn't have enough variety or options to meet our needs, it was just sort of...uninspiring.\n\nAfter finally placing our order, I ended up with a bowl of the French Onion Soup and the special of the day, braised short ribs served over mashed potatoes with a spicy sauce. The soup was pretty good, served the traditional way in a crock with baguette slices and an overdose of delicious cheese. It was a little sweet for my taste and serve sort of lukewarm (which I think may have been intentional since it was 115 degrees outside...but I still think I would have preferred it hot). The short ribs were good, very tender and the portion size was just right. I could have used some more spice in the dish, although I realize spice to the level that I like spice isn't all that common in French cooking.\n\nAll in all this is a pretty good choice if you're looking for dinner around the Paris hotel. The atmosphere is pleasant (especially if you can get one of the patio tables with a view of the Bellagio fountains) and the food is pretty good and relatively reasonable for its type and location."

The hostess snottily told us that she would seat us closer to our reservation time and handed us a beeper.  Two minutes later it went off, and we were seated.  We were a bit taken aback by this, and there were several other similar incidents.  I'm not sure where the haughty attitude comes from.\n\nThe restaurant has an extensive gluten-free menu, which was a real plus for my friend.  The entire table shared the gluten free smoked salmon appetizer, and it was quite good, including the bread.\n\nI had the filet mignon merlot with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the sauce is really exceptional.  I kept eating the potatoes even after feeling full just to finish the sauce.\n\nOverall, a decent experience due to the food."

After all, with views of the Bellagio water show underneath a shaded area (much needed for the 100+ degree summer heat), who wouldn't enjoy a delicious brunch while people watching? Mon Ami Gabi makes you feel like you're sitting in a Paris street-side cafe, enjoying a nice cappucchino and the breakfast dish you most fancy: smoked salmon eggs benedict, omelets, savory crepes, waffles. French toast... \n\nYou can taste the freshness in all their egg plates. Everything is just light and delicious - Brunch the RIGHT way... the way it's supposed to be!\n\nThe only downside is the service. Other than the greeters at the door, the waitstaff was horrible. No smiles and requests for items took forever. Our server was the most stone-faced, monotonous woman out of them all so I didn't feel bad reducing her tip. Hey, you earn what you put out, and no one should pay for someone to treat them poorly during a nice meal!"

We did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \n\nOur server offered us bread and whipped butter. The bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! My friend and I split a caesar salad along with steak bordelaise and I was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. It's a very, very, very small serving for $10. It tasted fine, you can't go wrong with caesar salad. When I got the steak bordelaise I was also disappointed. There was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. It did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. It was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. The fries weren't that amazing either. I really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \n\nOther people in our party ordered the natural chicken paillard, chicken broccoli and cheese crepe, grilled salmon and spinach salad, a cheeseburger and chicken and brie sandwich. The best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and cheese crepe along with the grilled salmon salad. \n\nNot sure if I would be back, I expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience."

We were seated right away because of reservations, you def want to get a reservation if you don' t wait more than an hour. We sat inside only because I feel it's not very clean being outside, don't want random bugs in my food, or rain. \n\nWe ordered the Bone-In Ribeye. Medium. Both of us, it comes with these flat crispy fries. I was in a a hoodie and jean shorts, and my husband was in a tshirt and khakis, we felt a little under dressed but no one said anything, there were others who had casual clothes on too, but it would be a nice place to dress up to also. \n\nMy Ribeye tasted like a sirloin. I wanted medium but it tasted like medium well done. It was hard and grimy. I didn't like it. The fries were ok,  I was too embarrassed to ask for ketchup. hahah. \n\nFirst time here, I'm not sure what else I'd order next time if I ever came back, Maybe try breakfast, I just thought this was an ok place to go.

Once we put our name down, we were told to come back in an hour.\n\nMy sister and I were seated at a table that was half inside, half on the patio (if that makes sense?).  This caused the AC from the inside to constantly blow in my face, as if I were standing infront of a fan my entire dining experience.  Considering how long we had to wait for the table, I endured the mild unpleasantness.  Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant.  If you need to use the facilities, you must walk through the packed restaurant, enter the casino and wait in line (only 4 stalls servicing the restaurant and part of the casino).  \n\nI ordered the steak bourdelais, which came highly recommended.  My sister ordered the steak roquefort.  We were starving at that point and scarfed down the baguette and butter and even the overly lemony orzo that tasted like that time I accidentally got lysol in my mouth (don't ask...)\n\nI guess the steak was too hyped up, I found it too sweet.

Mix of A/C and hot air is refreshing. Just a perfect, romantic ambiance. They really try to mimic eating in Paris\n- Escargo (snail) dish. Every single restaurant that serves snail, I will order. (There's not many). I love the large amount of pesto and butter/oil they put on the snails, but just IMO add a little bit more salt, ask for some lemon, then it's perfect. Don't be scared to ask for more bread too. \n\nThe food is definitely pricy but worth it ! I came during lunch hours, so it wasn't crowded and they were very efficient in serving and accommodating your preferences, whatever it is. \nAll the dishes were served with positive attitude and a wonderful aesthetic. Thankfully the taste is just as great, if not better, than it looks. Just order anything, because there is no sub-par or bad food here. Not many times you remember for the rest of your life what a great lunch you had. But eating here was definitely one of the times in my life when I really remember having a great lunch.

It was stupid because he told us what he wanted to order too! I don't really understand why we couldn't be seated? Anyways, he made it so we got seated outside.\n\nI would definitely recommend getting seated outside. It was super nice and relaxing rather than the really fancy place inside... My friend and I split the sea bass, which was a special and it was okay. I wouldn't recommend it and it was over $30.\n\nI DEFINITELY would recommend the french onion soup. That is why I am giving this place a 3 star WITH the view from outdoors and the ability to people watch (I mean it is Vegas after all....)"

We were seated right next to the outside seating area-- so we had a good view of the Bellagio fountains even though we were indoors.\n\nI thought the prices were very reasonable for the strip. I had the Frangria (their take on Sangria) which was a deal at only $5 per glass. My husband and I split the butter lettuce and arugula salad which was very good. The waiter also brought us a delicious baguette and butter, and an amuse bouche of carrot salad which was excellent.\n\nI had the steak frites roquefort and my husband had the chicken. Both dishes were really really good. Portions are very generous as well. My friend and her husband ordered the duck confit prior to dinner and were very impressed.\n\nWe had an amazing waiter-- super charming and very attentive. \n\nI have only positive things to say about Mon Ami Gabi, and we will definitely be back if we ever make it back to Vegas."

  "text" : "FIRST Vegas trip in August and I had bookmarked this place before I got there. It seemed like a great place to wine and dine (in the afternoon, HA).\n\nMade reservations because my lover and I thought it would be packed, but when we got there it wasn't that busy. This place is in the corner of the Casino, a bit hard to find in my opinion. When we walked in the host greeted us and asked where we would like to sit. I requested to be seated outdoors, but she had warned me that we'd be under direct sunlight, so we happily said NEVERMIND! When the host took us to our table, it was half indoors and half outdoors... as in we were outside pretty much, but there was a tarp above us.. kind of, I guess. Anyway, it was PERFECT! Highly recommend people to sit out there. Our server was very quick to greet and was extremely personable. \n\nEverything on the menu seemed so delicious, but we finally made our decision.\nBefore each entrée, they bring out a loaf of bread....................................... SO GOOD. I can eat bread and butter all day for days, but this one specifically I can eat 24/7. So warm and so fluffy. I LOVE.\nWhat we ordered:\nSeared Scallops - HOLY CRAP. Hands down the best seared scallops I've ever had in my life. It comes with a tangy mixed veggie/fruit (if I remember correctly) type of thing with 5 HUGE scallops cooked to perfection. My lover who doesn't even like scallops enjoyed a bite or two. It as AH-MAZING. Highly recommend. Some lady leaving the restaurant even did a double take at my plate and said, \"THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD\"! :)\nSteak and Frites - Thin later of steak did not look so appetizing, but do NOT judge on it's presentation. This dish too was so delicious. There was so much flavor in that meat. The frites weren't to bad either. My lover couldn't stop eating them.\n\nGreat service, great atmosphere, great food. What more could you ask for? DO IT!\n\nP.S. It looks pretty fancy shmancy inside, but don't feel intimidated. The staff is really nice and makes you feel comfortable.\nP.P.S. They also had some crazy bloody mary bar. Saw a lot of people taking advantage of that. Will definitely give it a try :)"

  "text" : "YUMMM !\n\nSo the last 2 times I've been to Vegas, I've eaten at this place. The first time I was brought by a Cold Tofu classmate that recently moved to the area. Its a nice French style steakhouse that serves steaks, sandwiches, seafood and the like. Walking in here really reminded me of my wonderful time in France and of all my amazing journeys. It seriously took me home :*)\n\nThe first time I was here, I tried the French Onion Soup, Moules-Frites and the Escargot.\n\nNow, I must say that since walking into this place brought back so many intense memories of happier times, I was really setting the bar high for the food. Maybe a little too high? If I were to compare my dishes to those I tried in France, then I must say that the food was just mediocre at best. \n\nThe French Onion Soup was definitely WAYY TOO SALTY to be consumed without the amazingly fresh bread that they brought out to our table. We asked for bread about 6 times throughout our meal, and every time, it came fresh outta the oven and PIPING HOT. THAT'S how bread should be (: On the plus side, if you're a poor college student coming to Vegas to party and want a slice of the good life, you could always come and order a bowl of French Onion Soup and dip it with the bottomless Bread they have here. That would DEFINITELY get you full while letting you basque in the French ambience for a while. Just saying (;\n\nMy mussels were also a tad on the fishy side, the sauce a bit too salty for my liking but my fries were outta this world deeelicious ! Although, I must say that they are definitely NOT French style frites. These fries are sliced thinner than usual and so they are crispy all around, and stay that way throughout your whole meal ! (Even 3 hours later back in our room at Planet Hollywood !) \n\nMy Escargot was also on the saltier side (Seriously, I used to smoke, so I definitely don't eat my food BLAND. If EVERYTHING I ordered was too salty for my taste than something's gotta give), but I think it had to be like that to help cover the \"unfresh\" aroma of the actual snail. Once again, that's where the bread came in handy ! The herb butter sauce that the escargot was prepared in was SUPER flavorful, it just had a handful too many pinches of salt and so it needed the super carb of the bread to help soak it up.\n\nThat night, the friend that brought me had ordered a Steak Bearnaise on my recommendation. (It was one of my favorites in France, along with the Steak Roquefort. NOMMM) The Bearnaise was a bit thin, but the flavor was SPOT ON. And it came with a side of their AMAZING frites that just complete the meal.\n\nJust a month later I decided to take the fam here for lunch during Labor Day weekend. There wasn't a wait, which was amazing for a Saturday at 12 ! They seated us in the BRIGHT dining area with open windows, and AC blasted on HIGH ! It felt so great to be able to be seated \"Outdoors\" without the 100 degree plus weather.\n\nThe menu is different for lunch, as it should be I suppose ! The entrees are a lot lighter, and there are more salads and sandwiches to choose from. We ordered the Tuna Melt, Steak Sandwich, Bacon Cheeseburger, and a Caesar Salad. Every sandwich/burger came an order of delicious fries ! I believe the only sandwich that stood out among all of our choices would have to be the steak sandwich. It was flavorful, the steak was tender and the side of au jus to dip had just the right amount of kick to it ! I believe it was a grainy mustard that made the difference ! The Caesar Salad was a total disappointment, I believe there were literally 8 bites of overdressed salad for $10 and we could have added another 2 and just got another burger or sandwich. WIll definitely NEVER order a salad form here again. I would have been MUCH happier with Wendy's Caesar side salad for $1 ! That's how bad it was :/\n\nAnyway, I know that I will definitely be back to visit this wonderful place again sometime in the future to try their Seafood Platter ! I saw a couple eating it together and it looked so SCRUMP-DIDDLY-UMPTIOUS ! Hahahaha, definitely needa find a bf to take me here for that one day (;\nHappy eating !"

I've seen those fountains at least a couple hundred times but I can't help but get excited whenever I hear the music go off - and it's that much better when you're sitting on a cute patio sipping a glass of wine.\n\nThe food at Mon Ami Gabi is good, the service is spectacular. \n\nFavorite dishes:\n\nChicken liver mousse - Oh my god. DELICIOUS. As gross as this may sound, it's actually really delicious. Served with cocktail pickles, onions, and slices of bread. Heavy and creamy, but the prefect way to start a meal.\n\nMussels and frites - I didn't order this, but my friend ordered the large which comes with a huge serving of fries. The mussels looked plump and juicy, and the sauce was to die for. FYI the 20 oz comes with about 8 mussels... so you definitely want to order a full order if you're looking for an entree.\n\nDuck confit - appetizer, but definitely entree sized. Kind of dry. Would pass.\n\nAnyways, make reservations, request to sit on the patio, and enjoy a nice French dinner on the strip. Do it!"

I haven't stayed at Paris in a long time, but find this restaurant to be worth the cab ride for a big breakfast. I'll wake up early for it ( which isn't always easy in Vegas), and I'll even eat alone if no one wants to get up with me. It's that good! \n\nI love pretty much everything on their menu, including their fresh baguettes, that are served with Nutella, and their other pastry, French toast, and waffle items. But, the breakfast I usually stick to is the Croque Monseiur. Two crispy pieces of bread with melted gruyere cheese in between, served with an egg over easy on top. Heaven on a plate! Also must have is their coffee, which is served in a cup, or if you love it like I do, can be served in a bowl. Yeah, it's a bit weird to sip coffee out of a bowl, but I'll do it. Because it's that good! Sitting on their patio, overlooking the strip with this meal, just can't be beat!\n\nCan't wait to head back...yum, yum!"

(If you don't have a reservation, you may have to wait a while.)\n\nMon Ami Gabi was one of my favorites from my last trip to Vegas.  My mother, sister, boyfriend and I came here for breakfast Monday morning.  There is plenty of indoor seating, but I would really recommend the patio because you get to sit right above the strip and you have a nice view of the Bellagio across the street.  Now, enough intro information, onto the food:\n\n-Coffee ($3.95): average.  free refills, as with any other place.  \n\n-Berry Pancake ($11.95): now, this isn't actually like the usual fluffy pancake, it's a \"big skinny pancake\" as their menu puts it.  I would just say it's very much like a crepe.  It was light and really tasty with the fresh fruits.  My boyfriend really enjoyed this.  The few bites I snuck were really tasty.\n\n-Chicken, brie and apple crepe ($12.95): Very savory and a little bit sweet; this crepe was everything that I was hoping for.  There was a lot of chicken in the crepe and the sauce on top was very good.\n\n-Ham and cheese omelet ($11.95): my sister always orders an omelet and she seemed to enjoy this quite a bit.  it came with a generous side of breakfast potatoes and some toast too.\n\n-French toast ($11.95): my mom ordered the french toast and it was really excellent.  if you like french toast, you should try this.  the toast itself is great, but the sauce, the blueberry syrup is what makes it.  The fresh blueberries go perfectly and the fluffy whipped cream- it's a divine match indeed.\n\n-Cream puff (free): we were celebrating my birthday.  I didn't t think I'd get a dessert for breakfast; but when it came to the table, I didn't decline.  Very tasty!\n\nThe service itself was just okay.  I think it's just because everyone is busy and rushing around.  The service was pretty helpful, but not all that friendly.  It's a good thing they won me over with the food.  Each of us thought that this was one of the tastiest breakfasts we had ever had and at these prices, it's very fair (especially for Vegas).    The portions were plenty to fill us, but not to the point of feeling stuffed.\n\nNotes:\n-If you're a guy, make sure you have sleeves.  I saw them give a guy a tee shirt because he was wearing a tank top."

We arrived at 6pm and was told it would be about a 25 minute wait for patio seating.

And that's exactly what we did with a couple glasses of wine!\n\nFOOD & SERVICE: I ordered the Steak Bernaise while my bf ordered the Steak Roquefort.  Both were delicious.  The steaks were the perfect size, the sauces were delicious and the frites were a great side and even better when dipped in the steak sauce.  Our great server, Francois, even brought us extra blue cheese sauce (came with the Roquefort) so that we had plenty for our frites.  We were pretty stuffed after our steaks but Francois convinced us to try his favorite dessert on the menu, Profiteroles.

Everything on the menu sounds so good and you will not be disappointed with whatever you decide to order. We were seated outside and even though it was over 90 degrees outside we didn't mind because they gave us such a good view. Our table was right across from the Bellagio fountains so we were able to enjoy the show while we ate lunch. \n\nI couldn't decide between a quiche and a burger. Since the restaurant is a French steakhouse I wanted to try something French, but at the same time I imagined that their burgers would be delicious as well, being a steakhouse and all. After a lot of pondering, my friend and I decided to share a cheeseburger and their classic quiche lorraine. \n\nThe food was SO AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS I would drive to Vegas right now to eat there if I could. First of all, they provide you with fresh French baguettes as you wait for your food. They are still soft and warm when they bring it out to you and it's so yummy with their whipped butter. The cheeseburger was very juicy and flavorful, not greasy at all! Their hand-cut frites were pretty interesting too. It was like a cross between a fry and a potato chip but it was good. The quiche was a lot bigger than I expected it to be and I don't think I would've been able to finish the whole thing by myself. It's the size of a small plate but the quiche is so light and fluffy that you'll finish half of it before you know it. I really liked the bacon that the used in it too since the bacon chunks were big enough where you can taste the smokiness and have some of the texture too. \n\nOur waitress was super nice and gave my friend a free cocktail on the house along with an ice cream puff dessert for us to share. The cocktail was so yummy that I decided to get one for myself! It was their special cocktail for season? day? not sure, but it was very fruity and light. It was a mix of some type of champagne and St. Germain which tasted amazing together!!"

  "text" : "We had reservations for dinner at Mon Ami Gabi this past Saturday, Sept 15th. We got there, were seated promptly and we got started from there. We ordered some wine...yadda yadda yadda - ON TO THE STEAK! I ordered the sirloin and it was simply delicious. It was very tender and juicy. I wasn't much of a fan of the fries (con frites?). They tasted like potato chips in the shape of french fries. I was expecting steak fries but that's my mistake and I won't ding Mon Ami Gabi for it. The mac n cheese was also fantastic. \n\nThe only knock against the place was that our waiter, while attentive, seemed pushy at times. We decided to order a round of shots for the guys - we wanted to just get the cheap stuff and he kept trying to upsell us to Patron shots for about $4 more per shot. We eventually gave in and did the Patron shots but would've preferred that he not try to be a salesman. All is well though because he hooked us up with another shot. \n\nAll in all, this place is great if you're looking for an affordable, fancy dinner spot in Vegas. If you're lucky enough, you can get a table outside that comes with a view of the Bellagio fountains. For 7 people, including 2 bottles of wine, a round of shots, appetizers, entrees and dessert, it came out to $580 or $82/person. Not bad for Vegas!"

You are right in front of the Bellagio fountains which is also a great site to see when in town. My fiance and I were in town for birthday celebrations and was pleasantly surprised to be able to get a seat at 11am on a Sunday morning. We booked reservations maybe an hour ahead. This place is usually crowded, so always try and call ahead. We got front row seats and enjoyed mimosas and cappucinos. The food is not authentic French, but close enough. Pretty tasty, but if you are counting calories, these butter rich meals are not for you. All in all a great sunday brunch. Highly recommed when you are in town."

I'd definitely recommend and come back for the location, reasonable price, savory food, and excellent service.  \n\nIf you are not in a rush, waiting for the outside seating, or near outside seating next to the bar, is well worth the experience.  The bellagio water show is nothing new to me but if you're new to vegas, definitely sit outside.  You'll get a host of envyous onlookers as they walk by and also see the water show across the street.\n\nAttached are some pictures of:\n1. Seafood Crepe - The scallops and prawns were AMAZINGLY delicious and generous in size.  I personally think the crepe robbed the seafood of the flavor, ha.\n\n2. Eggs Benedict - The english mufffin was a bit tough to cut through, but overall, the excellently poached egg (and I do mean excellent), ham, muffin and sauce were a symphony in my mouth.  The hash browns were well seasoned and delish...I only wish they had served the dish with more!!!  Potato is cheap, come on Gabi!  \n\nI noticed MANY people dining on the French Soup.  I didn't get to try it, but that is on my list for my next visit back to this restaurant.  \n\nJust Say Oui Oui to My Friend Gabi!!"

  "text" : "I've ventured to Mon Ami Gabi a handful of times- one of the few places that, as a local, I enjoy going to on the Strip- & truly feel it's a place everyone should treat themselves to, at least once. When I go somewhere like, say, PF Chang's, it's generally the same experience every time. Each experience at Mon Ami has been a different vibe but all equally enjoyable. Over the years, my g.f.'s & I have joked about playing hooky & meeting there for the afternoon. I'd recommend reservations, if possible; otherwise, depending on the day/time, anticipate a bit of a wait. I've never been disappointed by the fare. Leading up to today's celebratory work lunch, I had my tastebuds set on the chicken paillard but made a last minute switch to the prime steak sandwich. Upon my 2nd or 3rd bite, I enthusiastically declared \"I don't even like meat but if it all tasted like THIS, I'd love it!\" There's a misconception that Mon Ami is über pricey but it's really not that much different than going to places like Outback, Cheesecake Factory, (the previously mentioned) PF Chang's, etc. The ambiance is spot-on, even when it's a packed Saturday nite, & the service is consistent. A few items to take into consideration: warm brie cheese appetizer, mussels, chicken paillard, onion soup, quiche, warm chicken & brie sandwich, prime steak sandwich & flourless chocolate cake. Go. Eat. Take in the moment. Enjoy."

  "text" : "I usually steer clear of the strip when it comes to dinner out around town. The main reason being that everything is overpriced just because of the location.\n\nThis place is no exception, but not to such extremes as other locations. And being that there is such a limited amount of outdoor dining there on the strip, I'm willing to shell out a little more for the experience of dining ON Las Vegas Blvd. \nUnfortunately we didn't get that experience when we were here, and were tucked away at a tiny table right next to the door. \nNo big deal except we seemed to be a little to hidden from our server as well.\nThe table was tiny and felt like a table in a coffee shop.\nAgain this would have been fine if we were stopping in for a small bite at a cafe, but we were starving, and came for a serious dinner.\n\nWe ordered the Seafood Platter ($49.95) which is an entree meant to be split by 2 people, and in addition ordered the largest steak on the Steak Frites menu, the 22 0z. bone in Ribeye ($39.95).\n\nThe Frites were crispy and a real surprise, but the steak was a bit disappointing. It was a high quality cut, but the flavor of the steak just wasn't there for some reason, and it came at the same time as the seafood platter, which we specifically asked to have brought out as an appetizer and the steak later. So after we finally finished the seafood platter the steak had continued cooking for another 10 minutes on the plate to a little past medium, and had gotten cold.\nWe were a little disappointed but at the time we couldn't flag down a server to let him know we had a few issues.\n\nThe seafood platter was exactly as it should have been. Very fresh, and very filling. Although I'm not an aficianado on French food, and maybe I'm just a redneck who's eaten at Red Lobster one too many times...but I can't help but feel like I need some drawn butter with Lobster and Shrimp.\nOh well, Ces't la vie.\n\nService: 2 Stars\nFood: 3 stars\nPrice: 3.5 Stars\nAmbiance: Inside 2 Stars/ Outside 5 Stars."

We stopped in for lunch on Sunday, no reservation and we didn't want to wait, so we didn't get to enjoy the patio experience, maybe next time.\n\nThe food was fantastic, we ordered several things to share. We had the french onion soup which was perfect. The mussels were great and we had to keep stopping the wait staff from trying to take the bowl away as we sopped up every last bit of the yummy sauce with the frites. The frites are definitely a little different, not the average french fry like you would think. They are small, super thin and crispy. Good, but it would have been easier to soak up the sauce from the mussles with something a little more substantial. The fish and frites was really good, again not what you would expect as its not \"fish and chips\" - this comes out just a large piece of breaded fish on the plate, but the fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. And we also had the croque monsieur, the yummy combination of gruyere and ham on thick bread was sooo good. I've been craving one of these for days!\n\nAlthough our waitress wasn't terribly friendly she got the job done. There are so many workers running around, taking plates and bringing bread and filling water that I can't complain about the service.\n\nOverall, a great meal on the Strip - we'll definitely be back!"

With reservations for 8 persons at 7:45 in hand we entered a very small bar area where we could barely find a table of this packed place.  Hostess said table should be ready on time but SORRY even though you had a reservation and it was noted outside it's not guaranteed if you want to sit outside its going to be at 9PM  Strike one!\n\nFairly diverse menu French based steakhouse & bistro with some really great Boudreaux wines that were exceptionally priced and not overkill on the markup.  8 in tow for dinner I'll break it down as simple as possible hot French breach loaves with exceptional homemade butter was presented.  Waitress took forever to get to us and even longer to take our order after spending god knows how long chasing our wine down.\n\nAppetizers:  \nFrench Onion soup was good but nothing out of this world for 9.50 a bowl of soup and it was not piping hot, but lukewarm and very little cheese covered the bow.  Big miss here on simple French item. \nBaked Goat Cheese 8.95 & tomatoes sauce with warm garlic bread was better and the Escargot with warm garlic butter was a hit with two of my friends.   The mussels with white wine with herbs were also a huge success. \n\nEntrees:  \nNY Strip 39.95 with Béarnaise sauce was tasteless and cold to the touch and undercooked. Had to send it back but there was not much you could do to fix this.  The Steak Frites were impossible to eat tasteless also and Ice cold.\n\n22OZ Bone in Rib Eye with béarnaise sauce was better juicy and coated properly and it was temperature hot. Steak Frites Ice Cold\n\nDover Sole night's special neither was gummy and not very good nor was the chicken pallard pounded and covered with greens. A dry flat chicken breast that took nothing to make or present but it was screwed up royally.  \n\nCouple of half roasted chickens was OK but again nothing to write home about in fact all the entrees were either OK - passable or downright bad.  Theme of the night all the food was lukewarm. \n\nService she tried to be there but they are just too busy and overwhelmed as the food took over 50 minutes to arrive after ordering and the place is simply a cluster phuck on wheels as far as food and service. \n\nI'm really trying to be objective here for ambiance, etc but the bottom line is the food was mediocre, our reservations were not honored or shall I say ignored request, the food was not hot and the service was not up to par.  A GIANT NEXT for this traveling group as we won't be returning anytime soon.  They will continue to survive and thrive due to a prime location but there are so many other dining options available in this great city we won't be contributing to their success."

  "text" : "Ate dinner this time. Didn't mind sitting inside, so no wait YAY! Ordered a glass of Riesling, side of Brussels sprouts with bacon, spinach, and half order of mussels. \n\nAs always, love the fresh baguette. For dinner they also give a nice little apple, radish, vinegar salad that was really good. The mussels were just ok. Also, one of them was still closed, which you're not supposed to eat. Honestly, from such a nice restaurant, they're supposed to check in the kitchen and throw it out. This makes me wonder what else they may have missed... \n\nThe Brussels sprouts with bacon were really good. When they say bacon, they mean chunks of pork belly. It was AWESOME. The spinach was overcooked and boring. Again, I expect more from this place. I guess I should stick to the main dishes, but I don't eat very much and avoid large slabs of meat. I heard the waiter say they are known for their steak that is just cooked in butter. Maybe next time. \n\nOh yes, and dessert was the baked apple tartine. It would have been one the most awesome deserts ever had it not been sitting in a pool of syrup sauce. It soaked into everything, and it was like injecting my veins with pure sugar. I would try to order the sauce on the side, then it would be perfect.  \n\nOtherwise I think I'll stick to brunch. My last review from brunch:\n\nBrunch on Saturday. Ordered a mimosa and french toast. The french toast was served with house made blueberry syrup, with fresh blueberries on the side. Wasn't too sweet, until I got too full. Brought it back to my room to snack on later. Heated it up in the microwave, and it was still ok. Not as good, but still a good snack. All meals come with a fresh baguette. Yum!"

I could have had three servings of the warm goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer.  While telling our server how much I enjoyed it, she mentioned that I could leave my name and contact info and the chef would email me the recipe directly.  I have NEVER been in a restaurant where that option is provided and sure enough, two days after dinner, an email from their chef arrived to my inbox.  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for the high quality of the food.  I will certainly dine there again on future trips to Vegas!"

The bread came piping hot out of the oven with sweet creamy butter. The shrimp appetizer - delish. The drinks excellent; I had their version of a Moscow Mule. The steaks to die for, so tender and cooked to perfection. I had mine topped with gorgonzola, you must try! The profiteroles for dessert were yum and the cappuccino delightful.

  "text" : "This was one of my favorite dinners of all time. OF all time! \n\nIt wasn't lavish (spent a little over $150 for quality entrees, sides, and wine for 2), but I don't remember the last time I enjoyed dinner this much. \n\nFirst of all, we were seated on the edge of the outside patio, right on - but elevated - above the sidewalk of the strip. We had a view of the Bellagio when the water show was happening, and we people watched to our hearts' content (I am so glad we weren't seated inside, which was by contrast extremely dim - I Despise eating in dim rooms). The temperature outside was comfortable. We had a long, mellow dinner and it was perfect.\n\nThe Filet Mignon Merlot with butter and red wine reduction and hand cut frites was outstanding. If someone knows of frites in SF like the ones here, can you let a homie know? The frites were beyond delicious...they were FLAT (!) (I don't know how they made them so flat and perfect). Crispy and browned on the outside and soft on the inside...they soaked up the red wine reduction from the filet mignon...words cannot describe how good I thought they were. The red wine reduction was intense and tangy. The Filet Mignon was super tender. Did I mention dinner was perfect?\n\nI have since then been waiting for the day I find steak frites like I had at Mon Ami Gabi. I have made a few futile efforts but overall I'm not trying very hard...I want it to just happen one day like Mon Ami Gabi happened.\n\nI love when places unexpectedly sweep me off my feet with amazing food and wine, and an excellent environment!"

I had the steak bernaise.  I never hand a bernaise sauce, so the lemony buttery flavor really surprised me and I enjoyed it.  The sirloin meat was a bit chewy, but it's thin and if you cut small pieces, you don't need to work it too hard.  They serve a boat load of fries.  I guess for the price, we got a good meal.  I'm just not sold that it's a 4 star times 2000 yelpers.  Dessert was meh.  The apple tartin was nothing we expected.  We've seen many that have the apple slices fanned out making a lot of texture. This one was just one big slice of apple baked with the puff pastry on top.  I will say the food was 3 stars and the good service gives it another star."

We were seated in the atrium looking out toward the Bellagio Fountains after finding out the wait for outside seating would be 40+ minutes... but I think it's better in the atrium than outdoors.  Indoors, you won't be surrounded by people walking by chain-smoking and there's not too much wind, especially when it's a cool day.  The Eggs Benedict and Strawberry waffle were delicious!!!  Prices are very reasonable and the service is excellent.  \n\nOh, dress code is enforced in that men need to have their shoulders covered (so no tanks), but if you walk in with a tank, they give out shirts that the guys can wear :)"

Whatever you wanna call it.. \n\nThe food was not spectacular and as other reviewers have said, you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountains.. You can also people watch from the patio.. (Hey, what a concept huh? Just like a street cafe  you see in France!)\n\nOne glass of mimosa was $10! And the glass was tiny.\n\nThe prime steak sandwich wasn't too bad after you get through the end pieces, which were burnt. \n\nThe fries were actually good.. It's thinly sliced. They reminds me of fresh potato chips. I would not come back just for the fries. \n\nOver priced and mediocre food at best. But hey, you have to try it once."

The weather was nice and the view of the Bellagio's fountains was pretty, plus it was kind of dark inside.  The French Onion soup and the Triple onion soup were both excellent. My wife had the steak and I had the 1/2 chicken. Both were done to perfection.  The wait staff was very attentive and well organized.  It was a nice leisurely dinner topped off by an amazing apple tart tartin.  The cost was not too bad considering the location and the quality of the meal(about $100 for two w/o wine).

We were seated 5 minutes after my reservation time (not a problem), at an incredibly small, slightly uncomfortable table right next to the kitchen. I don't have a particularly big butt, and I'm on the slim side, and this table was so closed to the one next to it that I couldn't even help but bump into it - and there were guests seated at it. A table that small shouldn't even exist in a restaurant like this.\n\nOur server was great, not outstanding and not what I expected given the prices and atmosphere. What is really making me give this place 4 stars is that our food was amazing. Their \"house\" chardonnay was actually quite good and we didn't wait that long to receive our orders. I ordered a steak with peppercorn sauce, I believe, and my boyfriend ordered a 16 oz porter. \n\nIf I ever visit again, I'll probably choose to wait a bit longer for a better seat. But overall an interesting dining experience, not perfect, but just okay."

  "text" : "We were in Vegas on a cool October Saturday morning trying to find a spot for breakfast that wasn't Denny's or McDonald's.  We stumbled upon folks enjoying breakfast at a french-looking cafe at ... you guessed it, Paris Hotel.  We went in and were promptly seated just inside the bar area (not in the outside air, but close enough to feel the breeze and still enjoy a view of the strip).  We had great service from an extremely attentive waiter and an even better meal.  This is the kind of place where you order two eggs and they give you four, so be careful.  It was some of the best bacon I've ever tasted ... and enjoying a screwdriver made it even better.  There seemed to be no shortage of folks drinking alcoholic drinks at 10:00 in the morning (screwdrivers, mimosas, belinis, and bloody marys).  My wife had the belini and said it was the best one she'd ever had ... she's not with me while I write this review, but I believe it's pear juice and champagne.\n\nQuick and Dirty review:\n\nAtmosphere - Very relaxing and clean ... I'm willing to bet it's even better on a cool evening for dinner (especially with the lights of the strip and Bellagio fountain show going on)\nFood - Excellent (good portions)\nService - Satisfactory (visible and attentive, but not so much where it gets annoying)\n\nSummary - I could eat breakfast and/or dinner here every day of the week (I'm guessing lunch might get a little hot in Vegas).  I went there with my wife of 7 years, but for some reason it seems like a good first date spot ... probably because it's got a Paris cafe theme to it."

Anywhoozle, we start in on this guy about ordering our London broil benedicts.  He goes back to the kitchen and asks if they can make this, and as the story goes, Tammy over hears him.  She says to him, \"Is it a couple...did they order bellinis?\"  Next thing we know, here come Tammy to our table with a super nice little surprise for my wife!  She remembered us from before and just came to say hello.....are you kidding me!!!!  She remembered what we ordered, where we sat, and that the other customers ordered the same brunch after seeing ours.  Ha!

Sit there in the late Spring and early fall for a nice comfortable outside dining experience and watch all the jealous folk walk by and stare at your meal.\n\nPossible the best part about the restaurant is it's French theme and decor... when I walked in I swear I had seen the view from my eyes in some scene from some movie... good feeling.\n\nThough the prices are more expensive than their other locations I suppose it is comparable and priced accordingly to the caliber of cuisine they offer coupled with their location.  Nonetheless, their breakfast menu is reasonable and they have some good coffee options that remind me of sitting in a French Cafe.  Most people forget about breakfast but theirs is one of my favorites in Vegas.\n\nAs for the rest of the food, meats, salads and desserts are finely cooked, beautifully served and, of course, expectantly delicious."

It's usually crowded throughout the day, but it's certainly worth the wait especially if you aren't looking to dine in the $$$$ range until later into your trip. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nPrices are very reasonable (15-25) for Vegas standards, great people watching, spacious restaurant layout, and 3.5 food, 4 ambiance, 5 star prices... making it 4 stars in my book! So I say, EAT IT!!!"

Asked for inside but the staff felt it necessary to tell me (smugly) that an outside table wouldn't be available for 20 min. I had asked for a quiet table. They say me at a tight, small two top near the noisy bar. The greeters, etc. were very rude. Perhaps they were trained in France. The food - now there was nothing wrong there. Service was a bit slow but the food was amazing and worth the wait. Everything was delicious. I might go back here again, but even with great food when the staff is dismissive of my requests I tend to eat elsewhere. There are lots of places to eat in Vegas."

We were sitting on that edge between outside and indoors, and it was quite an excellent way to sit outside without feeling that Vegas heat. \n\nI told the waiter right away I needed gluten-free options, and she immediately put in a request for special gluten-free bread and a menu. I had to wait a little longer, like a few minutes after my party was served their bread, but I didn't care. \n\nBecause I was so excited to have the bread option, I ordered a sandwich. It was one of the best gluten free sandwiches I had. The fries were plentiful and good as well. \n\nI wish I would have looked at the dessert menu first, because I would have then scaled back on my fries consumption. I was served a complimentary ice cream sundae, and I could only eat half. \n\nI want to try the gluten-free chocolate cake the next time I go."

The most popular place to sit is outside on the patio, because you can watch the people walking by and feel like you're in a French cafe. I had the French Onion soup, my friends had the Lobster Roll sandwich and Chicken-brie sandwich. All were very good. The service was also good, we didn't have to wait very long for our drinks and food. Las Vegas has so many fantastic restaurants and I will definitely return to Mon Ami Gabi."

  "text" : "10.22.12 Mon Ami Gabi (Las Vegas, NV)\n\nThis is one of my favorite places to go to breakfast, lunch or dinner on the strip! Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. This restaurant has both indoor dinning and outside dinning. I highly recommend sitting outside so that you can see the lovely Bellagio Hotel water shows. Not to mention the people watching. Never know what you will see on the strip! Mon Ami Gabi is very busy so we decided to go late (around 9:30pm) for dinner. When ordering drinks, our waiter informed us that they were out of Disaronno. We ordered the Warm Brie Cheese appetizer and Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce). The appetizer came out and it was unusually small. As I was looking around I noticed a table next to us had ordered it as well and it was equally small. I also caught the waiter telling the customer they were out of whatever it was that he had ordered. I must say that this is very unusual and I most definitely will not be going again on a Monday night. Our steaks were wonderful and I will go there again for not just the food but the atmosphere. Dinner and a show!\n\n \n\n \n\nImpressed"

  "text" : "Location, location, location. That's the best thing about this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but what you're paying for is the privilege of dining on the Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Sunday brunch was crowded but we were smart enough to make reservations on our way down there.\n\nThe outdoor patio is the best spot to dine and if you can't get a seat out there, the space just inside isn't bad. It's like a green house -- light and airy with plenty of windows. Further inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes as the space is darker and more intimate. That might be ideal for dinner, but during the day your best bet is the patio.\n\nThe cream of mussel and saffron soup was decent but the prominent \"seafood\" flavor made it obvious that it wasn't made with the freshest ingredients. The brie and butternut squash quiche ($12.95) was a whole, round, individual-sized quiche. The flaky, crispy crust was the highlight of dish. Not wanting a dish that was too heavy, the lobster tartine ($17.95) was the way to go. Unfortunately, the creamy, citrus flavors dominated the taste of the dish.\n\nThe restaurant is family-friendly. Yes, they've got a kid's menu. The chicken fingers and fries ($6.95) come in a TV-dinner-style tray with three large, thickly coated pieces of chicken, apple slices, green beans, and ketchup. So, if you're looking for a somewhat upscale place with good food to bring the family, Mon Ami Gabi is a good bet. And, of course, if you're on a date, you can't beat the outdoor dining.\n\n3.5 Stars"

  "text" : "The best thing I ate whilst in Vegas over the past 4 days I was there.  I wish we could have sat out on the patio, but it was so cold and windy that night!  The ambiance is dark and romantic, yet warm and welcoming.  It has an old French decor and charm with a great waitstaff.  I was able to grab a reservation for a party of 4 in the cab on my way to the restaurant!  \n\nI ordered a salmon which came on a bed of quinoa.  It was cooked perfectly and the citron butter flavor really complimented the fish.  It was light but still filling, and best of all, healthy.  I also had a good chunk of the beef short ribs and the hanger steak, which were both amazing as well.  For $20 a steak that good is a great deal.  The only complaint I have is the frites, which are more like potato chips instead of fries.  I think actual fries would have given the dish more substance, but it IS their signature hand-cut frites...  \n\nThe menu was simple enough but not underwhelming, food, ambiance, and service was great, and for the quality of the food, these prices seriously cannot be beat."

  "text" : "We ate here once before but I'm a slacker that didn't review until visit number two. But, I am happy to say visit two was just as wonderful as number one.\n\nI came here for one main reason: the first time I came I saw a group of three European dudes enjoying their lunch like it was their last and I covent my neighbors steak frites. So, yesterday I made reservations at 1:30 for a late lunch. \n\nWhen you order they bring you a baguette for crusty French bread. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was chilly outside and this was a real treat. We started with some wine. I had the house Merlot which was surprisingly nice for a $8 a glass house wine. Hubby wanted a sauv blanc and the waitress brought two bottles out and had him try each to see which one he liked better. THAT, my friends, is service. \n\nHubby claimed not to be that hungry and ordered one of the specials: French grilled cheese with frites. Now, this seems simple but it had double cream Brie, arugula, avocado and bacon. It was stupid. Crunchy, ooey, gooey, and rich as hell. \n\nI got the Steak Roquefort. I felt more than gluttonous when I saw the couple next to me share my lunch. Yeah, I can eat. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that my steak was a little colder than I would like. Granted I ordered it medium rare but it seemed a little room temp like it sat there waiting for my husband's lunch. The frites were totally different. Think wonton chip like potato strips. I really really wanted a side of blue cheese sauce to dip them in. I was too afraid to ask for it as I thought that may move me from glutton to heathen. \n\nAll in all, a loaf of bread, three glasses of wine and two entrees,one of which involved steak came to $73 and the service was impeccable. Not kidding, I loved this girl. We have no idea what her name was but she was Asian and had cute glasses. She was charming. \n\nI cannot wait to go back. I want to try everything on the menu. Twice. And not in one sitting, though I thought about it."

I finally decided that I'd treat myself to a little romantic view of Bellagio fountains and came upon Mon Ami Gabi.  The wait time was pretty long for a single gal, but I put my name in for the outside area with the promise of 45 minutes.  Inside seating was about the same, however after I checked in I realized they seat via open table.  I then made a reservation for 15 minutes later and when I went to the hostess, she said she could seat me at that time (which was about 30 minutes earlier than what I was previously quoted so...internet res's have priority?)\n\nAnyway, I opted to wait the extra time just to have the view and dang it was really worth it!!  I had basically front and center to the beautiful fountain show.  I ordered a burger (I know, right?) - French cuisine isn't really my thing.  I did enjoy the carrot salad and bread and splurged on a glass of rose that was the perfect complement to my solo dining adventure."

  "text" : "(edited on 11/17/12)\n\nI have been there about 7 times. I like to sit outside - to watch Bellagio fountain show. \n\nFood quality wise, you can't compare to Robuchon or Bouchon - Mon Ami Gabi is a French version of Denny's. That's for sure. Or maybe worse... \n\nI've had Ground Ahi Tuna Burger and Bacon Cheese Burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've had seafood crepe - it is OK. Seafood is not fresh. Could be using frozen seafood.\n\nGratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. I am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\nTrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nFish and Chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. Kinda same as one at Todd English at Aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at French bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\nI USED to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. However, I went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\nJumbo Shrimp Cocktail - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! It tasted like dirt. Horrible! I'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. Gross!\n\nLiver Mousse and Pate - I guess no one orders these items here - I could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\nEndive salad - It is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nMussels - bad,,,,, They didn't break my expectation. NOT FRESH! At this point, I was concerned about food poisoning. So, I asked to get a check. It was enough...\n\nWhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! Don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nBtw, frites are better than Lay's potato chips. Complimentary Baguette is pretty terrible. You can get better baguettes cheaper at Albertson's.\n\nMy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. Just get burgers - cheap and simple. I guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nService - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. No refills. I saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nYou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to Denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nAlso, when I made a reservation today (Sat. Nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  This is Karma on Yelp, haha.\n\nI have been going there to see Bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... I will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for Bellagio's fountain show."

It is located at the front of the Paris Hotel & Casino on Las Vegas Blvd. While waiting at bar to be seated (about 15 min) the bar tender (Tyson N) was excellent and attentive even though he was swamped with drink orders. Once seated on the patio (across the strip from the Bilagio fountains) I watched as the fountains kept in sync with great songs by Frank Senatra, the Beattles and Michchael Jackson to name a few. The atmosphere was great and the waitress (Shelia H) perfect. The food was incredible: I ordered oysters on the half shell: a bit on the small side, but very tasty, escargot with a wonderful garlic and butter flavor, a Cesar salad and a glass of Kronenbourg. I could not have asked for a better dining experience and was not expecting such high quality at such a fair price in Vegas. Topped the night off with several hours at the roulette table and left a happy man. :-) Next time I am in Vegas I will likely stay at paris for easy access to this restaurant. Loved it!"

  "text" : "Wednesday November 21, 2012\n\nUPDATE : As you read the review below, please take the following into account. I was personally contacted by phone, by the manager of Mon Abi Gami, Constantin Alexander, who was sincerely apologetic and made a nice offer to make it right which we will accept.\n\nHe was able to find my number through my online reservation.\n\nHats off to Constantin at Mon Ami Gabi for caring about customer service ! I'll adjust the rating accordingly.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy original review ....Visited 7PM Monday November 19, 2012\n\nLike everyone these days, we are short on funds and time. So, when we went to Vegas for a short 2 day vacation (our first in five years) we spent a lot of time researching where we were going to dine.\n\nReviews looked good for Mon Ami Gabi - so we decided to treat ourselves.\n\nWe made a reservation, arrived early and asked to be placed on the patio waiting list. We did have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nFor appetizer, I had the French Onion soup. It was good, but nothing special. We make better at home. I was surprised at how fast it came out. I thought that would be great. but....\n\nOur salads came out almost immediately too, it was average too, and our entree only a few short minutes after the salads arrived. Way too fast, like they were trying to turn tables which is strange because there was no wait for walk ins when we left.\n\nPart of the way into the steak, which was also OK but not worth the price - think Outback grade steak - they turned on the overhead heaters built into the building. We were very comfortable outside before but these were so hot, my forehead felt like it was burning and my wife became ill.\n\nWhen I called them manager over, I told him we'd like to stay , have desert and relax but it was so hot we were going to have to leave. He just said \"We turn those on to suit the needs of the entire patio, and someone always complains about them being hot.\"\n\nWhat he didn't do was invite us to come back inside and have desert, maybe at a slight discount even, at one of the many empty tables, or apologize in the least. Hmmm... he obviously didn't know or care how long I'd waited and saved to have a nice dinner and getaway with my wife.\n\nThe good parts - the frittes (french fries) - were really good as was the free bread... all else very average. The responsiveness to the customer, way below average. It was also quite pricy. For that price we were expecting exceptional, not everage.\n\nJust FYI - the night before we dined off the strip at  the Brio Tuscan Grill just south of the Strip in Town Square. It far exceeded expectations. Each item we had was wonderful, perfectly timed. We spent $40 less there and had TWICE as good an experience.\n\nWe did decide we'll get to Vegas more, maybe a couple of times a year, guess where we will be having dinner....? We'll go to Brio and then watch the Bellagio fountains from the sidewalk. I am sure it will be a much better experience all the way around.\n\nBesides my repeat business, they also lost the business of a $100 gift card we were going to buy for our Son for when he and his girlfriend come to Vegas in February.\n\nMy guess would be, like so many businesses these days, they don't really care. I'll send them a copy of this and bet that I never hear back....\n\nJust FYI.. I TRIED to email them, but their contact system does not work properly.. oh well, I guess snail mail will have to do"

  "text" : "I had dinner at this restaurant years ago when it first opened and had a splendid steak with a Merlot butter.  I returned this past weekend for breakfast as I had been doing some research and this was highly recommended for breakfast.  We did not wait at all, but were there relatively early @ 9-10am for breakfast.  I am a foodie who studied to be a pastry chef years ago and love nothing more than a great meal where every bite brings simple and complex flavors to perfection... not to mention that french food is my utmost favorite ! The decor is very much a french bistro/cafe style which is somewhat elegant, yet comfortable and not stuffy.  You could dine here and get a good feel for what dining in France would be.  If you wish to people-watch then ask to sit on the patio, but I found it very loud with the traffic & music playing and opted the next day to sit on the inside patio, which was much quieter and more intimate.  Everything on the menu looked delicious.  I had the eggs benedict special, which included mushrooms and watercress, along with a delicate croissant (served warm) & french coffee.  My friend had the ham & gouda omelet with hash browns that were like no other I've ever had and I'd swear they were cooked in duck fat b/c they were so rich and flavorful.  The next day I returned to have the ham & cheese crepe and it was every bit as good as the prior day, if not better.  The croissant melts in your mouth and smothered with the raspberry preserves it was perfection. I was almost embarrassed to enjoy the meal as much as I did.  If you love french food, or simply delicious food, every bite will leave you waning more and you'll go home looking forward to the day you can go back again.  Next stop:  FLEUR"

The service was excellent but I am sad to report that I was not impressed with their food. I ordered the Escargot for my starter and Steak Classique for my entree'. The escargot was not bad but I've had better (in Nice :-) and at Orange Hill Restaurant in SoCal). The steak sounded really good based on the description on the menu and I think I read a review here on Yelp from someone who said it was the best he's ever had but unfortunately, it was just alright for me."

  "text" : "We went here for Thanksgiving dinner and had a terrible dining experience.  The bus boy spilled an entire glass of our wine over the table and it got all over the front of my father's shirt.  They were quick to get a bunch of napkins to soak up the mess on the table and then eventually changed out the table cloth, but I had to request that they bring us soda water immediately to try to get the red wine out of his shirt!  \n\nThe manager came over and didn't do a good job dealing with the situation.  He lamely offered to pay for my father's dry cleaning if the stain didn't come out.  No offer to replace the glass of wine or take anything off of the bill for the inconvenience.  So my dad had to sit there with a wet shirt for the remainder of the meal and wasn't compensated in any way.  Nor did the manager return to our table (as he promised) to provide his business card so that we could take him up on the offer to pay for the dry cleaning.  Very unprofessional.\n\nTo top it off, as we were eating our extremely mediocre turkey dinner, the waitstaff was panicked -- running around saying \"86 the holiday desserts!  86 the holiday desserts!!!  Are we even HAVING Thanksgiving dinner anymore??!?!\"  The kitchen had clearly underplanned and run out of the pecan tart and pumpkin bread pudding by 8:15 pm.  It was very distracting and unpleasant to have the staff yelling right near our table as we tried to eat our meal.  Somehow, our waiter managed to put two tarts and a bread pudding on hold so we still got ours even after this whole debacle about the kitchen being out of them, albeit they were cold and didn't hold a candle to the bread pudding at Gordon Ramsey Steak.\n\nNot recommended."

  "text" : "I felt just like I was back in Paris.\n\nMon Ami Gabi is just across the street from the Bellagio fountains, in (you guessed it!) the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.  As you walk in, you get the sense that there are multiple layers of this bistro.  First, wooden booths and a truly \"inside\" feel, and then you step into the atrium, which has lots of light and round cafe tables.  Or, you could continue outside to the patio with a great view of the Strip and the fountain show (or in my case, protestors).  Depends on your mood and the weather!\n\nWe started with a mini carafe of the St. Germaine cocktail - so refreshing and it filled both of our glasses, twice.  Then we ordered the duck confit, which was tasty but maybe a little under-seasoned.  I did enjoy my open-faced tuna melt with artichokes and olives, and my man's seafood crepes were excellent.  The presentation was also worthy of an Instagram photo posted to Facebook.  Nothing like a little food porn to liven up the scene!\n\nAnd the service:  our waiter Jose was good enough to warrant a compliment to his boss.   He had this way of just making everything perfect, and we had the sense that he genuinely wanted to meet all of our needs.  When he told us he'd see us at breakfast (slick ploy for repeat business) I truly wanted to be there the next day - I just couldn't wake up in time!"

It was just as heavenly as I remembered--- even more so, because I had tried to make it at home according to the recipe the chef emailed me (see last review), and I now knew that it was pretty tricky to get exactly right.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash, upon recommendation from the waiter and he was beyond impressed.  Who'd've thunk that simple old corned beef with an egg on top would be so satisfyingly delicious?\n\nThe waitstaff was a little irked that we asked to move to a table with more sunlight, and I don't blame them, as we were in the middle of brunch rush, messing up their seating arrangement, but they were nice enough to still accommodate our request (it was a bit chilly that morning).\n\nMy most important tip for you:  if you so choose to order a latte (they can make it vanilla), go ahead and order the \"bowl\" for an extra few dollars.  A $6 latte comes in a cup not much bigger than an espresso cup, much to my dismay.  It wasn't the price so much as it was that I just wanted more coffee than that.  It was delicious, regardless.\n\nAs always, the atmosphere was charming, and the Bellagio fountains were playing at full force for us.\n\nRemains my favorite spot on the strip to eat!"

The corned beef and poached eggs was to die for, freshly cut corned beef that is. I love that they give you bread right of the oven! The frangia was delicious, french wine mixed with grand mariner and fruit. My bf ordered the quise and a banana muffin, also out of this world. Again, he could eat their banana muffins everyday.  I was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant and I will be returning the next time I'm in Vegas.\nLastly, the prices were actually reasonable for Vegas.

I had come here back in June with my boyfriend but I happened to get super sick that day, so I couldn't eat anything. I wasn't about to let anything stand in my way this time! It was my best friends birthday celebration so we made a reservation and headed over to Paris. There was a wait as they said they were running behind, so we grabbed a buzzer and waited about 5 minutes. We were shown to our table which was right next to a window (and a vent)...us being girls and ready for a night on the town, our party dresses weren't exactly adequate for the temperature in there. We were frozen but determined to enjoy ourselves. We actually ended up asking if we could be moved because the inner part of the restaurant was a lot warmer, and there were some empty tables. Our server told us that the restaurant was full but she could bring us napkins/tablecloths to wrap ourselves in. WTF??? We ended up moving to the table right beside ours which offered some mild relief. We ordered drinks and started with the warm brie as an appie. and it was amazing. The bread brought to our table was rock hard and difficult to eat/cut...after we had a few pieces, our server took our plates before we got the Brie so we had nothing to eat on. For our mains I ordered the beef medallions wrapped in bacon, they were awesome. All of the food tasted heavenly, but our server never once returned to our table to ask how things were. We actually had to flag her down at one point because we were finished and one of us wanted to order something else. They did bring out a little dessert with a candle for my besties birthday, which I thought was sweet. The food was truly exceptional but the service was pretty brutal. However, I'll likely come back to sit on the patio for that gorgeous view. Perhaps we just had an off night with a bad server."

It was freezing outside and there were more patrons seated outdoor than indoor! Well, thank goodness for those warm heat lamps! We chose to sit outdoors on the patio next to one of those heat lamps! The location of this restaurant is great because it sits right in front of Bellagio's water show. It was nice to see what water dance every 15 minutes. :)\n\nOkay, so the dinner. We ordered smoked salmon with cream cheese as an appetizer and for our entrees I ordered their giant scallops and my hubby ordered a steak. The smoked salmon was super delish and very fresh. I can honestly say this is probably one of my favorite appetizers. My scallops were just as good. Very soft and flavorful.  My entree also came with mashed potatoes topped with brussel sprouts. Who would have known that the combination of the two would be very tasty?! My hubby enjoyed his steak though he thinks it tasted mediocre. \n\nOur server was very generous. I asked for hot water (since it was so cold!) and he made sure my water was warm throughout the night. He even replaced my pot of hot water with a new one!

I dare say that my filet mignon might have been the best one that I've ever had! The sauce was spot-on! I am the type that likes their meat more flavorful, so the filet was all that I've dreamed of and more. Everything else we had was delicious, though I was far too stuffed for dessert!

Try to eat outside on the patio, not only will you get to enjoy a lovely meal amidst the bustle of the Strip, but you will also get a great show from the Bellagio across the street.  If we ever come back, this restaurant will also be on the list.  Not that this is any big surprise, but a bottle of wine there is 250% more than the equivalent at Walgreens; for the romantically thrifty, stick with water for a bevy."

  "text" : "Terrible service.\nMy friends and I came in for lunch on a Saturday morning.  It was crowded, but we had a reservation and were seated right away.  Unfortunately, after we ordered, it took over an hour for our food to arrive.  When it did arrive, it was obvious that the food had been sitting out for quite some time, as it was completely cold.  Most egregiously, my friend's crepe had been sitting out for so long that the sauce had congealed.  We asked to see the manager.  When we explained the problem to him, he was completely unapologetic.  While we understood that the rest of our food might have looked fine to the staff, we showed him my friend's crepe, which was obviously congealed, and explained that it never should have been brought to us like that.  His response was to tell us that maybe we should work at the restaurant.  After this incredibly rude comment failed to convince us to drop the issue, he eventually took her crepe off the bill, and took 50% off the remainder of our entrees.  While this eventual response was appropriate, it would have been nice if his first instinct had been to apologize and try to make up for the restaurant's errors instead of to ridicule our concerns.  The sad thing is the food seemed like it probably would have been delicious if it had been brought to us hot."

  "text" : "We arrived around 11 am for a leisurely Saturday brunch on a sunny morning.  We were secretly hoping we could sit out on the beautiful open patio to soak up some Vitamin D, but the 45-minute wait almost put the ravenous D and E over the edge.  Thankfully, the patio waiting list is separate from the rest of the restaurant, and we walked right in and were seated immediately.\n\nThe front part of the restaurant near the host stand is quite dim, which could be intimate and romantic in the evening but was a bit of a downer for the morning.  Which is why we were thrilled when were seated close to the glass window-ed atrium, adjacent to the patio.  Our server was courteous and kind, bringing us extra brunch menus and then rounding up breakfast menus when we admitted we were hoping to get a late breakfast.  By the time we ordered, he had no qualms about all of us getting breakfast at 11:30, even though the kitchen technically stopped serving breakfast at 11.\n\nOur table enjoyed beef hash (with poached eggs!), quiche lorraine, smoked salmon eggs benedict and a mushroom omelette.  The hash brown potatoes served with the egg dishes were crispy, light and simply one of the best we've had.  I was surprised by the light custard texture of my quiche lorraine and enjoyed the chewy chunks of bacon.  However, 3/4 of the way through, I found the rich flavors a bit overwhelming.  The fresh and lightly dressed frisee was an excellent side to my quiche.  Maybe the quiche was just too big of a portion for me?\n\nD and E would not stop talking about their beef hash.  They were clearly in love with their dishes.  The coffee was tasty, and the warm crusty baguette they served us while we waited for our dishes was such a relief for our growling bellies.  They amply refilled our bread supply and included a great jam to spread on top.  I tucked the rest of the baguette in my purse as a snack, since they bring the baguette to your table in a paper sleeve, as if it came straight from the farmers market! \n\nThough the interior is quite upscale and nice, there were a good number of families with kids and casual diners to keep the atmosphere from feeling too stuffy. :P"

The rest of the restaurant is quite dark, but the sunroom is also really nice if there's no space on the patio.\n\nWe were here for brunch/lunch, so I ordered the quiche lorraine. My friends shared the escargot, and had the chicken crepe, croque monsieur, and chicken and brie sandwich.\n\nEverything tasted great, but didn't wow us. Like most French food, everything was quite rich, so it was a pretty heavy lunch. I loved the fries; they were thin and crunchy.\n\nWe also shared a pitcher of frangria, which was quite strong (we're not huge red wine drinkers), but with some added lime juice it tasted much better.\n\nWould love to come back to try their steak."

He keeps coyly suggesting they hang out when we arrive in Sin City. \n\nOne of the girls coos, \"Where would we go?\" (bats lashes)\n\nHe tells her, \"Whenever I meet a beautiful girl in this city, I like to take her to Mon Ami Gabi. The food is amazing, it's not that expensive, and it's very romantic...\"\n\n\"Sounds nice,\" purrs the other. Both girls giggle. \n\nOnce upon a time I would have rolled my eyes and rifled through the seat compartment for a vomit bag, but more mature these days, my vexation was overpowered by the prospect of a killer restaurant recommendation. Amazing food? Not expensive? Romantic? Sold! \n\nThree days after I landed, I managed to convince some pals to join me for a late lunch at this Mon Ami. We all ordered the steak frites, which arrived rare and in slices. It was very tasty, fries and all. I also ordered a cocktail that had gin in it, but the name escapes me. I loved it. \n\nWe were seated in a hexagonal greenhouse gazebo type thing, white, with all windows. It was quite lovely, actually.

When we arrived (after walking past the patio that was maybe half full) we were rather rudely told that it would be a 45 minute wait.  Why did I make reservations?!  Given that it was a Friday night, and we had other plans, we elected to sit inside rather than wait.\n\nThe service for that point on was decent, nothing very impressive.  We waited quite awhile to see our server, and then another long wait before finally placing our dinner order.\n\nThe food was fantastic. We had escargot, oysters, salads, the roasted chicken, and the scallops.  All were fantastic.

We came early enough that there wasn't a long wait, so we were seated rather promptly. I had the Croque Madame, which honestly, was fantastic. It was just what I wanted and had great flavor. It came with homemade potato \"chips\" which were more like potato straws, but they were delicious. My companion got a breakfast sandwich, which he thought was alright (too much mayo for a breakfast sandwich), but did enjoy the side of breakfast potatoes.\n\nThe problem with the service was that we hardly saw our waitress. I don't know if she was overstretched with tables or what, but we were constantly out of drinks and I had to wait 10 minutes to find her just to get another OJ. When we finished our meals, we sat there for 15 minutes with empty plates in front of us before we could get our table cleared, and then find her for our check. I felt very overlooked while she waited on other tables (mostly larger groups).\n\nAnyway, maybe I was there on a bad day or just got a server on her off day, but with all the choices in Vegas, not sure that I will be back."

  "text" : "Welcome to Disney Land!  A beautiful façade of a Parisian cafe worthy of a single visit.  After that, the spell breaks.  \n\nQuick and dirty:\n\n- Three dining spaces (outdoor overlooking LV Blvd facing the Fountains of Bellagio, indoor sun room, indoor steak house). \n\n- Three check-in lines (outdoor wait list, indoor wait list, confirmed reservation).\n\n- Franco / American café menu at reasonable prices.  \n\n- Great selection of French wines by the glass or bottle.  Glass prices are VERY high.\n\n- Friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked French accents for some tables, Parisian style silence for others).\n\n\nThe food is below average.  High point;  the baked brie starter.  Served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  Unctuous.  Rich.  Just good eats.  Unfortunately, the escargot is the opposite.  Tender morsels of snail dressed with hard parsley stems.  Ack.\n\nMains fail to deliver. A paltry two ounce, steak sandwich served with an overly reduced, sweet onion au jus.  A croque monsieur made with pressed deli ham.  Very low quality (sub USDA choice), albeit inexpensive steaks.  Frites that accompany almost every dish are terrible.  Some crisp, most soggy, rubbery, and oily.\n\nWorth a single visit to enjoy a bottle of wine and see the fountain show.  After all, the Parisian authenticity is enhanced by the confetti of playboyesque images on cards that litter the sidewalk below and well lit mobile billboards of  scantily clad \"Hot Hot Hot Ladies\" crossing your view."

  "text" : "You know over the course of several years Ive revisited Mon Ami on several occasions and each time has gotten better than the last. I used to laughingly refer to Mon Ami as the Olive Garden of French restaurants, homogenized versions of French bistro classics. But as I grow older and (hopefully) wiser Ive found that this isn't really the case. Yes this is a chain but they do try to do their best with what they do. I re-read my previous review (2008) and wow did I just sound like an arrogant dick. I apologize for that and sure I could delete it but think its much better left to show a contrast of me growing up. \n\nNow with all that being said, I have to say that I always crave their ribeye steak slathered in deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce when we visit. This is Vegas and there are loads of steakhouses pretty much everywhere but for the price point this steak is a great value as well as a great taste! Its slightly fatty, beefy richness is cooked exactly how I love it, medium rare. This IMHO is the only steak on the menu to order. While the lesser priced steaks are alright its only a few bucks more for the ribeye. \n\nIf you haven't tried it, the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer is super tasty. Creamy goat cheese melts into the tomato sauce fortifying it with amazing flavor. It comes with a slab of garlic butter soaked bread which is kind of greasy so I opted for hot fresh baguette. The frisée, kale and bacon salad make for an awesome salad that's covered with a single poached egg. You know you can put warmed egg yolks on anything and it'll taste good. The dressing is nicely acid with a slight sweetness that cuts the bacon and egg richness. So good.\n\nWho knows, maybe my supposed standards have gone down or perhaps, just perhaps, good food is just good food no matter where it comes from. Regardless of the case one (me) doesn't need to act like an arrogant bitch about it."

  "text" : "Ummmm why did I not come here YEARS ago?!!! I've probably been to Vegas nearly 10 times since Mon Ami Gabi opened and always figured this was a tourist trap and therefore the food would be meh. WHOA was I wrong! Okay, well it still is a tourist trap --- BUT a DELICIOUS trap if I may say so! My gays and girls went to Sunday brunch here on a whim. They immediately sat us at a fantastic table facing the Bellagio fountain in the atrium. The dining room is so dark, but that atrium is where all the light is held hostage! \n\nOur friendly server explained the menu and we got to ordering (because we were STARVING after a night and *ahem* morning of drinking)... My friend and I split the french onion soup since it looked massive and decadent (and it was!). It was just right! Cheesy, ooey and gooey, and just salty enough. Mhmm! Oh and since they give every fresh bread to start off with, the soup accompanied that just beautifully. Yay for dipping it in the soup! My girlfriends took advantage of the Bloody Mary bar. OMG the fact you can make your own Bloody Mary is reason enough to come! They have hickory sticks!! I don't know why that got me so excited, but it did. It made me want to run to the Hickory Farms store and get reaaaall with buying some! (I know. Sounds kinda sad. Guilty food pleasure...) \n\nI ordered the steak sandwich which sounded \"ordinary.\" Well, hell to the no it wasn't! WOW. That cheesy bun, the mayo sauce, the steak, the jus... and fries?!?! SUNDAY FUNDAY FOR SURE!! I also ordered a Republic of Tea for an iced non-alcoholic beverage. YUM. \n\nWhile I know this is not necessarily the most authentic French bistro food, it was still dang amazing! Perhaps that is still the post-partying foodie talking in me, but hey, if you want something satisfying and reasonably priced (especially for Vegas!), this is the place to go.... oh, and the Strip view from the atrium (or patio) during the meal? That's half of the experience right there! I have to return!"

  "text" : "I've been wanting to try this place for years now ever since the cute name (and exterior) caught my attention. And I was able to this year after my mom finally agreed that we could have breakfast/brunch there before we left Vegas and headed back home to LA. I am so glad we were able to squeeze it in! I called the night before at 11:59 pm (a minute before closing time) to make reservations for 11:30, and the lady was friendly.\n\nWe arrived early, but were quickly seated with no hassle. I asked for a seat outside and to my surprise, that was easy enough although the place was very crowded already. We were seated at the edge of the outside patio by the sidewalk. But after about 15 minutes or so, the direct sunlight became unbearable for some of our party of four. So when another outside table by us that had more shade opened up, we asked if we could move and the service was prompt. We noticed that a few minutes afterward, several tables also wanted to move because the sunlight started shining directly on many of the seats. \n\nWe each got different dishes, and they were all so delicious and tasty. My dad, who was paying for the bill, thought that the prices were reasonable for the portions. I was delightfully surprised by his comment because he typically doesn't feel portions are big enough for him to be satisfied. Haha. He had an omelette and pointed out that the pieces of turkey were uniform throughout his omelette (as in there were pieces in every bite) -- even the thinner parts, which he said is a detail that is typically not the case at diner omelettes. Hah. The omelette was as long as the plate and came with hash browns and slices of bread. \n\nMy mom (and I as well) loved the complimentary baguette that was provided a bit after we sat down. So fresh and just perfect texture! It came with jam and butter too. I tried a few bites of my sister's quiche Lorraine and it was so light and fluffy as quiche should be! It came with a small side of salad, which she said as simple as it was, tasted really good. I got the holiday special of eggs benedict with braised beef instead of ham after the waiter recommended it. Delicious! Quite possibly the best eggs benedict I've had. The homemade muffin was perfect -- crispy edges and softer center, and melt-in-your-mouth eggs. I could have had more beef, but it wasn't so little that I would complain out loud about the amount. Still very fulfilling, especially with the side of hash browns that the egg dishes come with.\n\nThe juice and tea was quite pricey to me at ~$4 each for a pretty small glass. But they're freshly squeezed and thus, refreshing as well. I was satisfied with my grapefruit juice while my dad ordered orange juice and my mom got hot tea (it was organic and came with lemon). \n\nI would love to come back for another visit. Their scallops and steak seem amazing. Yum."

I overheard others complaining of waiting over 30 minutes, I was able to be seated in 15 with my reservation. The waiters were attentive and very patient with the harried diners. It's well located along the Strip, facing the Bellagio where you can catch the light and water show every night, or just do some people watching. Now for their raison d'être. The baguette is fresh out of the oven so that was a nice plus. The steak frites were fabulous. Their frites are different from any I have ever had before.

Turns out it's pretty damn crowded, but they're seating every party with no problems. They tell us to stand by the side until they flag down a waitress to seat us. We can a little earlier around 12:15, so I expected to wait a few minutes but I waited much longer. Fast forward 20 minutes and we're still standing there while they seat parties of 10. Apparently they forgot about us. -1 Star.\n\nWe finally sit down and our waitress comes to us and she was lovely. We ordered the duck confit to start. I ordered a warm chicken and brie sandwich while my friend ordered a medium rare steak. It takes a while for our appetizer to come out, in which time the staff breaks about 3 wine glasses throughout the restaurant and the shattered glass is everywhere. Okay, promising.\n\nDuck confit is dry. So dry. Has OK flavor, but just so damn dry. \n\nMy warm chicken and brie sandwich was clearly sitting under a heat lamp for a while because all the brie had melted off the sandwich and the chicken was dry.\n\nSteak was cooked very medium instead of medium rare.\n\nEverything but our waitress was so underwhelming. I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends."

  "text" : "My husband and I made reservations at Mon Ami Gabi for Monday (12/24/12). There was a line of people without reservations in front of us and when I approached the first host desk, the two girls there told me to go inside to the next hostess stand and tell them that I had arrived and we would be taken to our table. -WRONG- I waited patiently for the hostess to finish speaking with another guest (without a reservation) and when I told her our party was here she glared at me and said \"Ma'am, did you wait in that line?\" \"I was told by those two over there to come in here.\" \"Go to the back of the line.\" I almost walked away from the restaurant, but went to the back of line and waited...for about ten minutes beyond my reservation time for a party of 10 people -without- reservations to be seated in front of us. \n\nWhen we were finally shown to our table, we were shoved against a wall. It took about ten minutes for the waiter to welcome us to the restaurant and take our drink order. He seemed really pissed when we didn't order any alcoholic beverages and went over the specials so fast that we didn't really hear him. It took forever to get refills on our drinks.\n\nWe ordered the brie, which was fairly good. My husband ordered the special (veal) and he said his food tasted good. I ordered scallops and mine were chewy in a bad way. Our waiter only checked on us one time in passing throughout dinner. We were obviously an afterthought.\n\nThis restaurant doesn't have its own restrooms. You have to venture out onto the casino floor in order to use the bathroom. \n\nI would not return to this restaurant. The food wasn't up to Vegas standards for the price we paid and we were treated badly by the hosts and the servers."

Lovely classic service by people who are actually interested in food and proud of their jobs; a well-run bar; classic cooking with a nice edge to it; reasonable prices for the level of dining.\n\nI had the French Onion Soup and Beef Bourguinon, husband had the Lobster Tartine and Scallops. The soup is a real win - rich onion and beef broth, a hint of sherry sweet and a generous coating of cheese over that secret broth-soaked bread. Bourguinon is made with beef cheeks, and is crazy luscious. The portion is substantial.\n\nThis is the place if you appreciate good food, and know how a restaurant should operate."

  "text" : "This was my favorite meal during our recent trip to Vegas in November. We went to higher priced establishments for dinner (Bobby Flay's and a Wolfgang Puck place, but they didn't compare to the casual ambiance and street views from this perfect place for lunch. We enjoyed the food, the service, and the views of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nA tip for tourists, be sure to plan for a late lunch when eat here. Early afternoon (anytime after 1:30) is the perfect time of day to eat and sip sangria at a slow pace without the restaurant being overly busy. Yes, you will still wait for a table at 2:30 in the afternoon, but it will be much better than 12:30! Peak times should be avoided to get the full bistro experience. Also, it is well worth the additional 30-35 minute wait for a table outside.\n\nThe fries are salty, crisp and highly addictive. You have been warned!\n\nWhen it comes to restaurants in Vegas, I feel like the prices just keep going up and up and I love that Mon Ami Gabi offers delicious food at a reasonable price point. I can't wait to go to Vegas again so we can enjoy another late lunch on the patio.\n\n\n** It will always be busy, and during breakfast, lunch and dinner hours, it will be crowded. There are two lines and usually hostesses that make up their own rules about reservations and no reservations on the spot. Don't be in a hurry and don't be rude and eventually you'll sit down and eat. There is a good reason this place is always so busy - it's good!**"

Sometimes, it is a miss, but I still really enjoy coming back to Mon Ami Gabi. It is super quaint as one can sit inside or outside. I usually prefer outside seating, but then it gets too sunny. But I still love it.\n\n* Onion Soup Au Gratin Baked with Gruyere Cheese $8.95 (5 of 5) Yummy. So much cheese. I love it. It is one of my favorite places to order French Onion Soup. \n* Sea Scallops Gratinees with Caramelized Fennel & Onion Marmalade, Mussel Cream $12.95 (3.5 of 5) So cute. I didn't realize they made stainless steel scallop plates so they can put the scallop into the oven. Fresh and tasty. But more pieces would make me happier.\n* Steak Au Poivre-brandy peppercorn sauce with Signature Hand Cut Fries $25.95 (4 of 5) This steak is flattened, so don't expect it to be a thick cut. Looks like a piece of liver, but tastes like a piece of juicy steak. Very unique to this restaurant and pretty tasty. But I don't favor their choice of cut fries. It is like flattened cuts of potatoe. Not to my liking. \n* Maine Lobster Roll toasted brioche roll with Gaufrette Potato Chips $17.95 (4 of 5) Fresh and tasty. The roll was soft and lightly buttered toasted. Very delicate but held the lobster meat quite well. No complaints here and I enjoyed their Gaufrette Potato Chips on this dish more than the Signature Hand Cut Fries. \n\nThis is one of my preferred restaurants on the Las Vegas strip. I really enjoy this bistro and always down to bring others to try this place."

  "text" : "A little bit of Paris, smack dab in the middle of the Strip.  It's a perfect lunch spot with a grand view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, the fountains don't start running until 3 p.m., so I guess if you're here in the summer, come for an early dinner (and avoid the lunch time heat if you're on the patio), if you're here in the winter, just come for lunch, minus the active fountains.  Don't be scared, they have heat lamps everywhere.  \n\nFor seating, try to request either the open air patio or the enclosed glass ceiling bistro area (does remind me of bistro floors in Paris, only cleaner and brighter).  The formal seating area inside is dark and gives off that reddish brown light of a stuffy steakhouse.  If the restaurant isn't packed full, then you're safe, because they default to seating people outside or in the bright covered area.  \n\nI started with a Frangria, which I'm sure is not French.  It's red sangria that had good fruity/sweet balance and was inexpensive.  \n\nHeavily recommended by my server was the French Onion Soup (which I normally love), but I didn't order it because I would've been too stuffed.  Next time.  Our server was very attentive.  \n\nI had the Steak Frites/Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce, $25.95) medium rare.  The steak is big flat piece, smothered with peppercorn sauce.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  The steak frites are definitely worth getting, just pick your preferred sauce (butter, caramelized onion with red wine reduction, peppercorn, blue cheese).  \n\nThe frites/fries that accompany the steak are thinnish potato shavings that curl a bit after frying.  Have you ever tried Pik-Nik Ketchup Fries from your grocery store?  Their cut reminded me of that, except they have more give on the inside from fresh frying.  Unique, yes.  I can see how some people would love these fries while others might hate them.  \n\nShe had the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad with avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing ($17.95).  The salad was a solid choice, the citrus salmon played well with the avocados and blueberries.  \n\nWe were here for lunch.  If you come for dinner, you get more choices on the steak cuts.  Added choices include filet mignon, hanger, New York strip and bone-in rib eye.  \n\nThis is a very relaxing place to have a meal with one of the grandest views in all of Vegas, I can't wait to come back!"

It was awesome to see the bellagio fountain show while eating dinner at the same time!\n\nI've heard the steaks here are amazing and decided to get the peppercorn steak. I thought the steak was extremely tender and I could tell it was definitely very fresh. One word of caution is that the steak served there is thin (unless you get the filet mignon). They gave tons of chips as well and it was nice to eat the chips along with the steak!  \n\nMy sister got the french onion soup. It was the best french onion soup that I've ever had. It was very tasty and went perfect with the bread that is given to you at the beginning. \n\nOverall, I was satisfied by the food and ambiance. I would definitely come here again!"

  "text" : "I'm gonna have to make my first yelp review on this place...\n\nWhat can I say?!  I'm really impressed by the food and portions Mon Ami Gabi offers considering that it's a French restaurant with very reasonable prices.  I've been to Vegas 7 times since the time I've turned 21, and have only tried out this place out earlier this month, but thank goodness I've finally taken the time to try it out.  I'm gonna have to make it a point that from every Vegas trip on, I'm going to make every effort to come back here!\n\nWe had made a reservation via OpenTable for 8:15 and was slightly late, but they were accommodating and almost seated us immediately anyways.  Server was attentive, and had recommended us the Filet Mignon Merlot since it's the most popular so that was my dinner choice.  The other girls in our party had the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, Steak Bordelaise, and Chicken Grandmere, and we all shared the Whipped Cauliflower and Macaroni Gratin sides.\n\nFilet Mignon Merlot and Filet Mignon Au Poivre were both on point!  Medium rare for the two of us and I could not get over how tender the meat was and how effortless it was to cut into it.  Both were served with Frites, which I obviously could not stop myself from also devouring considering how much I love potatoes/fries.  Haha.\n\nSteak Bordelaise on the other hand wasn't as impressive... comparatively to the Filet Mignons, but not bad for it's meat cut.\n\nChicken Grandmere was also to die for.  I haven't had a chicken this good since Beatrice Inn in NY!!!  Seriously so tender and juicy, was not dry AT ALL.  Would be my second choice if I wasn't much of a steak eater.\n\nWhipped Cauliflower was the first I've had of it's kind, and was super nomsy!  Was pretty much like mashed potatoes ... but more like super creamy mashed cauliflower.\n\nMacaroni Gratin was also a meh... nothing spectacular to rave about.\n\nBut overall, I had a very pleasant time.  The decor and ambiance is quite romantic and perfect if you're looking to have a nice, classy dinner away from the rest of the crazy Vegas life.  I'd love to eat here again and try eating outdoors with the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!"

We ordered medium rare but it came out kinda grey with grill marks so definitely more rare than medium.

I don't know if the recipe or chef changed but it was definitely different. It was still a good  bowl of soup, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nThis time, I ordered the sea scallops for my entree. I received four large scallops cooked to perfection. It came with brussel sprouts and an amazing cauliflour puree. Would highly recommend this dish. \n\nI have to also applaud the restaurant for being extremely accommodating to my friend who has a severe gluten allergy.

  "text" : "A nice average/above average French restaurant in the Paris hotel, with reasonable prices. However it ranks high because of the genuine cultural ambiance and the lack of attitude and pretentiousness along with reasonable prices, all rare in Vegas. The onion soup was good - not great but very good. The escargots were very nicely spiced and arrived sizzling hot. The \"sushi grade\" ahi tuna was fairly fresh although not extremely fresh and the spicing with pepper was a tiny bit off. Scallops were good although very slightly undercooked in the center. It's important to say, that all of the food was very edible and enjoyable and these are just quibbles. Espresso drinks were actually good, not the watery swill you get elsewhere in Vegas. For 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, alcohol for one, and 2 espresso drinks, the tab was $93, which I thought was very reasonable. Appetizers are around $10-12 and main entrees are around $18-22. The service was excellent and professional and quick. We got to sit on the patio and watch the fountains and the people walking by. Very fun and a break from being in a dark cavern inside somewhere. By the way we have eaten here three times and keep coming back because there doesn't seem to be another outdoor bistro quite like this on the Strip."

I'm a visual learner so I'm going to break this down into Pros and Cons, just a warning there is going to be more in the cons column!\n\nPros\n- Beautiful decor and lighting in the bar at least.\n-Gluten free menu\n-reasonable prices\n-large portions (almost too much, like your own personal flank steak on a small serving platter)\n-good bread\n-fun little cream puff with a candle for your birthday\n\nCons\n-Noise level, tile floors are nobody's friend\n-extremely small waiting area (it's compromised of the hostess table, the bar and table seating)\n-Service, pretty poor and lackluster, came back to the table twice, I noticed the table on the other side of us, had the same problem, trying to track down their fries before their meal was over\n-No outside alcohol, (which I understand, but when rudely asked to drink it or it will be tossed, doesn't bode well for the rest of the evening)\n-Reservations (this is what really burned my baguette; I made a reservation a week and half+ before the big day. I said it was my birthday and that we would have two people that are hard of hearing in our party and anywhere that was quieter would be great, maybe that was a ridiculous request but I don't think any of my requests were actually acknowledged that night. So with our two week advance reservation we arrived 30 minutes early and were told to wait, I had gleaned from other reviews that the seating times were a little delayed but we waited an extra 15 minutes on top of ours, so after shuffling through the crowd at the front, we are shown to our table and didn't have to walk far! It was 20 steps from the doorway and two steps from the bar and ordering system, so for my 27th birthday instead of a view of the Bellagio fountains I stared at a black floor mat and paper table covers! I was flabbergasted when we sat down and once I came to my senses I  asked the hostess if there were any other tables available not in the bar, she checked and said if we wanted to wait another 30mins there would be something then. Before you think I'm some disgruntled birthday girl, the table next to us, a husband and wife celebrating a birthday as well, were also dismayed to learn that their reservation meant a romantic view of the bartenders legs, they however had a better server and managed to get a better table, I guess we should have gone donner party on half of our group to get a worthy seating assignment.\nSteak- the frites weren't anything special, the steak was tender but almost like it had been tenderized (Mom and Grandma both commented); the top layer had that mealy texture. This is coming from someone who eats steak like twice a year and was really looking forward to a good one. So to put insult to injury the steak I had consisted of a four inch section of sinew down the middle, you couldn't cut it! I told the waitress, which I never do, I am not a picky eater and never want to step on someone's toes ( bad haircut, no prob it'll grow out!) but tonight I had enough, she understood, took it away, brought out a new one, and comped it, which made up for the misery a little.\n\nSo on a whole this night was just so bad I had to write a review, I think I would have been happier with In-N-Out!"

  "text" : "Mon Ami No More!  I loved this restaurant.  Seriously.  With all my heart and soul...I loved the view, the ambiance, the waiters, the food and the je ne se quoi (sp), and I had had a long-standing relationship with this restaurant, visiting at least 2-3 times a year for the past 4-5 years.  It was love at first bite and I never made a trip to Vegas without visiting at least once.  Now, I'm afraid to say, I'm not likely to go back.  \n\nOn a recent visit near the end of December, I was excited to bring 3 friends to Mon Ami.  Now, while the restaurant is known as a steakhouse, they offer many fish dishes on their menu.  On the night we came in, with an 8 pm reservation, we were informed that they were out of ALL of them.  The waitress quickly let us know, very unapologetically, that they were out of lobster, mussels, skate, trout, salmon, scallops and any other fish on the menu that evening.  We were hell-bent on getting the mussels, one of our favorite appetizer dishes at Mon Ami, and one of our visitors had his heart set on lobster.  When we asked why there was no fish available, when clearly it was largely offered on the menu, the waitress simply answered \"our fish truck didn't come today.\"  Now, mistakes happen.  The world is an imperfect place.  Fish trucks miss their deliveries.  I am not a restaurateur (though I know one in the Henderson area), but I would imagine that a restaurant of this size with the volume of business that Mon Ami does  would have a back up plan should a truck not arrive.  If not, might I suggest that there is a Whole Foods store less than 3 miles away where perhaps they might have gone to pick up some fish?  \n\nAfter expressing our disappointment, the waitress shared that she heard a rumor that some mussels had come in, and she would bring them to us right away.  She did, we ate them, they tasted gummy and fishy and we complained about them for the rest of our trip.  After eating steaks con frites (umm, what else were we supposed to eat at that point), we left, disappointed with the restaurant's lack of selection and poor planning, but mostly, with how their staff chose to handle the situation...without any true apologies or sense of ownership.    Unacceptable, for a long-time AMI."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is practically a landmark. In fact, this place is so deeply-engrained in my childhood memories that I can hardly imagine thinking about Vegas without being reminded about this restaurant. Yes... I spent a lot of time in Vegas as a child, don't ask me why.\n\nDespite the fact that Mon Ami Gabi is probably one of the most tourist-populated restaurants on the Strip, the food here is actually quite food and affordable. I have very fond memories of their croque monsieur, mussels and frites, crepes and benedicts. \n\nWhat I was actually very pleasantly surprised by on my recent return with the bf however, was the level of service at this constantly bustling place. Our server (who lived in Chicago for a while, as we learned) was cordial, attentive, and absolutely accommodating. Not only was it a breath of fresh air from the typical customer service in Manhattan, but it was even impressive for Vegas standards. Well, the olive tapenade with ricotta and toast, seafood crepe, and my frisee and kale salad with warm bacon and poached egg weren't too shabby either. \n\nAdd to that the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains either from the patio seating or brightly-lit pavilion section, and Mon Ami Gabi really is one of the best places to relax after a crazy night.\n\nHmm, I guess I had pretty decent taste even as a small child. Ha."

  "text" : "I first came to this restaurant at the same time last year after reading reviews on Yelp. This year, we make it a point to come here again. We also invited some friends. This place is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. It has a very romantic ambiance whether you sit inside or outside where you can watch the Bellagio fountain show. The prices are reasonable and not ridiculously high. The service is top notch and the food is just absolutely delicious. \nThey serve you with warm tasty bread the moment you are seated. We always order sparkling water and their fruity sangria which has a hint of rosemary. The onion soup is always a must. It is just divine. My boyfriend always orders the filet mignon. The flavor is sumptuous and cooked to perfection. I ordered their mussels which came with french fries. It was cooked well and the juice is adequately flavored and salted. It was a bit creamy. Our friends ordered the salmon and roast beef. They also loved their dishes and thanked us for taking them to Mon Ami Gabi. For dessert, we ordered the pudding and it was delicious. \nThis restaurant will always be in our itinerary when we visit Vegas, that's for sure. \nFYI: Be sure to make a reservation to avoid waiting a long time. If you want to sit outside so you can watch the Bellagio Fountain while eating dinner, you way have to sign in anew and wait. The wait depends on how busy they are. Last year we waited a long time to be weated outside, this year we did not so it just depends. But having a reservation is better not having one and be ready to walk around Paris for a few minutes if there is a longer wait time to get seated outside. Don't be afraid to sit outside either because they have plenty of powerful heating lamps."

Came for lunch, and it was pretty busy, but we were able to snag a table for 3 inside (but it was close to the window so it was still bright and had a view of the Strip) with no wait! And the service was very friendly and attentive. And they give you a cute little baguette for the table!\n\nHowever, the food left something to be desired. The onion soup was tasty but not that memorable, and the chopped salad was a lot smaller than we expected. I ordered the sandwich special, which was pastrami and gruyere. I assumed it would be on a French roll, but turns out it was served between toasted slices of bread that were extremely tough to bite into... And the sandwich itself lacked flavor (other than the mustard spread). On the plus side, the hand-cut fries that came with my sandwich were great!\n\nOverall, I liked the atmosphere, and some of the more unique menu items might be more worthwhile, but I wasn't very pleased with the ones we ordered."

The patio is raised above the busy Las Vegas Boulevard sidewalk, so all those inebriated tourist don't get in the way of the view.\n\nIn my opinion, the food at most of the restaurants on the strip is overhyped and overpriced; this is NOT the case at Mon Ami Gabi.  The food here is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and appropriately priced.

Mit großartigem Blick auf diesen und das gegenüberliegende Bellagio. Das gesamte Restaurant ist auf französisch getrimmt  und gelungen.\nSchon wegen des fantastischen Panoramas sollte man einen Tisch auf der Außenterrasse wählen (Reservierung empfehlenswert). Denn dort bekommt man gratis zum Essen und Trinken lebendiges Kino im Superformat. Das quirlige Leben auf dem Strip und vor allem des nachts das viertelstündliche Schauspiel der von Musik untermalten Fontänenchoreografie (http://www.qype.com/place/228958-Fountains-of-Bellagio-Las-Vegas) des Bellagio-Sees.\nDoch zurück zum Mon Ami Gabi. Wer hier speist, sollte nicht unbedingt die Alibi-Angebote amerikanischer Küche wählen, wie Burger oder ähnliches. Wer das wählt, outet sich als Genussbanause. Davon scheint es jedoch einige zu geben! Dabei ist das Angebot an gehobener  französischer  Küche verlockend und man sollte sich dem ruhig hingeben. Wir jedenfalls wurden nicht enttäuscht:\nVorab Chicken Pate und Country Pate (je $ 9,95), anschließend Lamb Shank ($ 26,95) und Steak Bordelaise ($ 25,95). Zum Dessert Profiteroles ($ 7,95). Die Flasche Morgan-Wein kostete $ 47 und schmeckte vorzüglich. Über 80 verschiedene Weine werden angeboten, da fällt die Auswahl schwer. Aber man kann auch den Wein glasweise bestellen (wine by glass) und so ein wenig die Vielfalt testen.\nErfreulich: Für Kinder gibt es ein spezielles Kindermenu.\nFazit: Wenn die Bedienung französisch sprechen würde  die Illusion wäre perfekt. Aber auch so fällt es nicht schwer, hier ein Hedonist zu sein. In Frankreich sind Bistro-Restaurants nicht preisgünstig, hier ist es ebenso. Das Gesamtpaket Mon Ami Gabi hat uns sehr zugesagt, fünf Sterne fallen uns leicht."

I had the endive salad which was actually a quite beautiful presentation and tasted delicious as well. For desert we had the creme brulee which was as good as I've had in a while. Overall we were very happy with this place, we had a delicious dinner, made it to our show in plenty of time, sat outside and watched the 'interesting' people on the strip...all for about $130.00.

  "text" : "I am taking the time to inform you of my unacceptable dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas on January 20, 2013, from 11am-1pm. We came with a group of 10 and were seated promptly, with our drink orders taken and fresh bread served. There were a few incidents where I found my dining experience unacceptable:\n\n1. My friend ordered the corned beef hash, and shortly after ordering, the waiter returns and says they are out of corned beef hash. This is disappointing but acceptably okay, but given this is Las Vegas, and a huge restaurant, how do you run out of such a popular dish, especially at a time like Sunday Brunch? I wanted to order this but changed last minute after hearing the special.\n\n2. The second incident was when our waiter told us the specials of the day, so I ordered the \"Portobello\" eggs Benedict. Except, when our food came, the waiter tells me it's \"pork loin\" eggs Benedict instead of \"Portobello\". The thing is, the waiter should've known what the specials were, and second, he should have came back and told me earlier, the same time he told my friend they had ran out of corned beef hash, that the special was not \"Portobello\" but \"pork loin\". I would've have elected to switch to something else. I do not want \"pork loin\" eggs Benedict, and my second choice would've been the corned beef hash, which the restaurant ran out of. The worst thing was that he told me when our food came, so it wasn't like I had any choice to change my order. I was starving and didn't want others to wait for my food to arrive so they could start eating while they already had their food served, and there wasn't really anything else I really wanted on the menu. Had the waiter informed me earlier, at least I could have ordered something else. The waiter, did however, said he would check back to see if I wanted to change my order, and when he did return to check back a long while after, I was more than three-quarters done with my food because I was way too hungry, and I wasn't enjoying the food, but merely eating just to fill up my stomach. I was rather upset by that. \n\n3. The last incident was my other friend's hot water. She ordered a tea, and needed a refill in the hot water. The waiter took the pot, and never returned. When we asked the waiter about the hot water, he replied, \"oh, we gave it to the other end of the table.\" Obviously, the waiter forgot about it and made it up. We ordered 3 hot teas, and now there were only 2 hot water pots. I mean, normally it wouldn't have been a huge issue, but I was already upset from my meal. \n\n4. Given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. I was starving!\n\nThe service was nonetheless friendly, I wouldn't fault the waiter. The fressi, kale, warm bacon salad was good and light, however the bacon was cold. Both the chicken liver and pate were on par.\n\nIn conclusion, I was quite disappointed with my dining experience. The view was great, they had nice fresh bread (although the butter was cold and hard), and that's where it ends. Given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. I was starving!"

We ordered the warmed brie for an app and it was good, but came with 3 toasted slices of baguette.  3 slices for two people?  Is it really going to break the bank to add one more piece so a party of 2 could share the brie with 2 pieces of bread?\n\nI ordered the Steak Roquefort and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot.  We both ordered our meat medium.  We also ordered a side of green beans to share.  We were halfway through our bottle of wine (and we aren't fast drinkers) before our meals arrived. The \"Roquefort\" was actually a blob of butter with some Roquefort mixed in.  There was so little Roquefort in it that I asked the waitress what was on my steak.  \n\nIn addition, my steak came barely warm and totally raw on the inside.  Fortunately, my friend enjoyed the filet Mignon.  By the time the waitress came back, returning the steak was no longer an option since I figured we would have to wait another 30 minutes for a replacement.\n\nSince I was still hungry, I decided to order the Bananas Foster Crepe thinking that there was no way they could do a dessert wrong.  I am not a Bananas Foster pro, but I believe it is supposed to be served warm (as the description states warm bananas).  It was served cold with the sauce being more crystallized sugar rather than a warmed flambe.  Basically they pre make these, barely warm them and pass them off as \"gourmet.\"  \n\nI came to the restaurant looking forward to a wonderful meal and evening, instead I was disappointed at every turn and the $150 bill was very hard to swallow."

Once again, another Vegas trip, another visit to Mon Ami Gabi, another new dish to try out on their outdoor patio.\n\nSo I stopped over for Breakfast and this time around I tried their Classic Quiche Lorraine with bacon, Jarlsburg cheese, and caramelized onions.\nhttp://bit.ly/Ul3awt\nWhat surprised me most about this quiche was the size.  It was almost like a pizza!!  This was my first quiche so I basically had zero expectations for it which all the while made this dish special.  It was pretty much like giant egg custard tart, but savory with bacon, onions, and cheese.  I really enjoyed every bite and would order this again!\n\nService was once again spot on.  Had the same awesome waitress I had from an earlier meal so no problems there.  And coffee service was always around to top off my cup as usual.  I swear if you want to experience awesome service, definitely come by here for breakfast.\n\nMon Ami Gabi never fails me!  The food is always consistently good!  I'll be back again soon!!"

They accomodate groups but I'd suggest you make reservations ahead of time because this place is quite popular and is crowded on a weekend evening. Just keep in mind they won't seat you until your entire group is present...yep, we had to wait a while since people from our large group kept wandering off every time they were ready to seat us haha. \n\nThe food was great, and I had a steak that was tender and cooked to perfection. Their wine selection is pretty great as well and we ordered a few bottles of reds for our table to share. The staff is friendly and attentive, and kept coming by to check on us. I'm not an expert on French cuisine but this place was pretty good. As for the ambiance...I have no idea because we had a large group and were more focused on discussing football and parlays before, during and after our meal..."

The energy was great. We sat inside but  they also have patio seating. Servers were exceptionally nice and prices are reasonable.\n\nThey served complimentary bread with butter and beets. It was so fresh and delicious. For my entree, I ordered the  hanger steak and it was by far the BEST STEAK I ever had. It was so mouth watering. The steak was juicy and tender with lots of flavor. The frittes was so crispy and delicious.\n\nI am marking this place as a go to spot every time I'm in Vegas. I am definitely taking the BF here.

I will go back time and time again for their Quiche Lorraine! \n\nGreat location as it overlooks the Bellagio fountains and just a good place for people watching. I love the hustle and bustle of the diners, servers and runners. It makes for a great combination of lively and noisy, if that makes any sense.\n\nI recommend going for brunch or lunch. Their simple yet delicious omelettes and salads are just that...simple and delicious. My motto is: serve food that is tasty and provide service that is memorable and the restaurant will be a success. That is what Mon Ami Gabi has strived to do and I commend them for that.\n\nSome other dishes I recommend:\n-Seafood Crepe\n-Cream Puffs\n-Ham & Cheese Omelette\n-Everything!"

We shared a full order of mussels and macaroni gratin (mac n cheese) and Brussel sprouts.  The mussels were big and juicy, macaroni gratin is made with gruyere and was very yummy, Brussel sprouts were made with bacon making them very flavorful.

And sure they have outdoor dining where you can look at everyone walking down the strip, but that didn't matter since I was on the hunt for some steak frites.\n\nBut at the end...it was just ok.\nI have had some steak frites before and had some really good ones including the Paris version in Relais: http://www.yelp.com/biz/relais-de-l-entrec%C3%B4te-paris-3#hrid:1iL8osb1Dx8fjln2JegOBA/src:self\n\nAlthough this place does have the steak frites...it wasn't the same or better than the Relais version. It was good, but nothing worth getting all excited about. But if you're in Vegas and you want some \"steak and frites\" then this place is probably you're best bet. \n\nI did like their Bananas Foster Crepes which I had for dessert. They have other desserts too like profiteroles au chocolat, and creme brulee. And besides the steak frites, they also serve brunch here too.\n\nI managed to get a table because I made reservations in advance, otherwise you would probably have to wait awhile as I noticed a lot of people loitering out in the hotel lobby area. So again, make reservations here."

The steak sandwich is a deal at $16, and my friend got a chicken and brie sandwich for $14, I believe - both were delicious. We sat on the patio and you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains (minus the palm trees on the Strip in between) and it's a great way to people-watch as well.

  "text" : "As others say, this is really at the top tier of breakfasts in Vegas.  On every weekend trip, it is my Saturday morning treat (as Sundays are now reserved for the Bottomless Mimosa Brunch at Border Grill in Mandalay).  \n\nThis French Bistro packs a combo falcon punch of awesome!  Between the outdoor deck (with heat lamps, so it can be enjoyed year round) that allows for fountain and people watching, the impeccable service, and... did I mention the food?  This place will slow you down and MAKE you feel like you're ON Vacation, which is so important in this fast paced world, right?\n\nWhenever I go here, I opt for decadence, so my usual breakfast rundown is:\nMocha\nKir Royale\nSmoked Salmon Eggs Benedict (Isn't it weird that you can get better smoked salmon in Vegas than most places where I live in the Pacific Northwest?)\nand I finish it off with their Orange Chocolate Chip muffin... one of the most decadent desserts (but they call it a breakfast pastry), I think I've ever tried.  HUGE hunks of chocolate, with an orange glaze, on a soft cakey dough.  It's amazing.\n\nThere aren't really any cons I'd give this place other than: \nBe aware that their breakfast ends at 11, which is earlier than some Vegas spots.  Lunch is still great, but sometimes after a hard party night in Vegas, you just need some Breakfast.\n\nAdditionally, note that there are also locations in the following cities: \n-Chicago IL\n-Oak Brook IL\n-Reston, VA\n-Bethesda, MD\n\nIf you are local to one of those areas, you may want to try something else when Vegas bound (but then again the deckside view may just be worth it even if you already eat a Mon Ami Gabi Brunch regularly).\n\nIt's really an excellent experience."

Bread for the table is complementary and with a salad makes a great lunch. Steak frites are tasty and the mussels in broth are excellent. \nService was prompt and friendly.\nThe best people watching is on the outdoor patio overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. Heaters are available during the winter. Try for a table along the railing next to the sidewalk. Also great view of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant does not take reservations for the outdoor patio. However, you can make reservations for indoors. The best seating indoors is along the windows facing the outdoor patio next to the door way entering. This spot offers good people watching of those coming and going."

  "text" : "If you want a nice restaurant that won't leave your wallet crying and your stomach still starving, this is not a bad place to go. Just be sure to make reservations or the wait can be quite long. Reservations only guarantee the indoor dining area, which is dim, romantic, and not conducive to Instagram pictures. If you can, though, I'd recommend the patio area so you can people-watch from a heated and equally romantic vantage point.\n\nThe boyfriend and I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, which was served with 4 large pieces of the creamiest salmon I've ever had and (maybe just a tad too much) red onions and capers atop brioche. The filet mignon merlot was definitely on the small side and probably could have done with a little less cooking, but the merlot reduction tasted amazing. What I should have gotten was the boyfriend's ribeye, which was bigger, fattier, juicier, and overall just more tasty. I was not, however, impressed with the steak frites that came with our entrees--they were paper-thin (like eating a deep fried potato peel) while I like more substance to my fries. \n\nThough the food was a little hit or miss, the ambiance and the attentive server who kept up with my water-guzzling boyfriend's refill needs upped my rating for this place to a 4."

  "text" : "My review for Mon Ami Gabi is based on a mish mash of happy hour visits and raves from friends and family about their experiences here. \n\nWhen I use the term happy hour, I mean that I went during happy hour times.  There don't seem to be too many happy hour deals.  But that doesn't matter because the wines by the glass are superb, the mixed drinks are well done and the french beer is great.  I sat at the outer bar both times I visited.  Its directly across the street from the Bellagio, so you get the fountain show every 15-ish minutes, whether you want to or not!  I ordered the frites to snack on and they were great.  \n\nThe people watching factor is unbeatable.  The patio is right on the strip so you can watch the people flood by, but the patrons inside are just as interesting.  People from all over the world.  \n\nThe bartender was great, a super friendly fellow midwestern transplant.  He got us hooked up with the frequent diners card which is valid at a couple of other restaurants in vegas that fall into the Mon Ami Gabi family of restaurants.  Well worth the investment if you are a regular.\n\nNow for the \"not my experience but worth writing about\" piece of the review.  My husband visited here when he was in town solo.  He has pretty specific dietary do's and don'ts.  He requested a seafood crepe minus the dairy and Mo Ami Gabi was happy to work with him.  The server said that they get special requests all the time and almost all of their dishes can be made to accomodate.  In a world of \"no substitutions\" and \"no changes\" menus this is a super selling point for us.  \n\nI would recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone looking for a great place to eat, drink and people watch on the strip."

If you just want a great breakfast/brunch place to go to...check out this place. It's across from Bellagio (Paris Resort area).  My wife and I went there for brunch one morning. I got the steak and eggs, and my wife got the Nutella waffles. We just split our plates so we could try each other's.  The steak was tender and juicy. It's a small streak and actually goes well with the scrambled eggs.  With that, you also get some toast. This meal was great! My wife's Nutella waffles were awesome too. I think the mix of salty (my food)..and sweetness (her food)...just made everything taste good. It's not crazy expensive and it's totally worth it.  The service was great too. Our waitress was really nice and from observing the other waiters...I could see some actually playing with babies...and interacting with families. It's something that is rare to see nowadays.  \n\nDefinitely check it out. Sure there are the buffets, fancy restaurants, and other restaurants...but if you want to go to a nice place with family or your significant other....and eat some good food....go here :)\n\nKeep in mind- we went for brunch....so I don't know how lunch/dinner is.\n\nHave fun!\n\nJonas"

My biffle and I shared a half order of the mussels, as well as the steak bordelaise.\n\nThe mussels were my favorite part of the meal. They were perfectly cooked, and bathed in a perfectly seasoned, rich (but not too rich) sauce. There were thin strands of onions in the sauce as well, which I though went along beautifully with the mussels.\n\nThe frites, or the fries that come along with the steaks are quite unique. They are a hybrid, a cross breed of a fry and a potato chip. I prefer soft fries, but for those who like crunchy, yum!\n\nI'm not really a steak person, so I didn't love the steak... but the sauce was good :) Eventually got waaay too buttery and rich, but I couldn't stop eating it!\n\nSuper happy with my dinner date here, but it might have been because of my lovely company.

Lovely.\n\nIf you're searching for gf vegan menu, this restaurant doesn't offer that,  but many of the side options listed on the regular menu, such as brussels sprouts and sautéed mushrooms, are gf. Two typical desserts conclude the menu, chocolate mousse and creme brûlée. Both options are good, but take the waiter's advice and try the brûlée instead.

Instead he just said, \"why don't you give it a try and see if you like it\".  ?!?!?\n-  Our food took FOREVER to come.\n-  My other friend ordered the corned beef hash, but it wasn't until we had waited for who knows how long before the waiter came back and said they were all out of corned beef hash.  How do you run out of something sooo common?!\n\nI was totally turned off by our waiter.  And most of the food is not really worth writing about.\n\n-  Eggs Benedict.. meh\n-  Tri-tip sandwich... meh\n-  Salmon salad... yuck\n\nThe two highlights were the blueberry french toast and chicken liver pate.  Definitely recommend those."

It got pretty good reviews on Yelp!, but I was tricked by Yelp! earlier that day into going to a horrid nail salon (review to follow) in the area. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was good and I STILL can't believe how reasonable the menu was. Our party asked for a window seat and although the restaurant was packed, they saved us a nice lil' table with a gorgeous view right next to the window.\n\nWe got the chicken liver pate, the country pate and escargot to start. Chicken liver pate was by far our fav. They serve it with this horseradish sauce that just kills it. The country pate was kind of a disappointment, but the escargot came to the rescue ;P.\n\nThe mussels were super super yummy. Not grainy at all and surprisingly fresh. Everyone at our table raved about their entrees and had a great time.\n\nWe ordered the creme brulee and apple tartin for dessert. Both were super yummy, and they even threw in a free birthday dessert.\n\nAll-in-all, a good dining experience. Mon ami gabi has earned a permanent place on my Vegas To-Eat list..."

Just bring your sunglasses because the umbrellas don't shade everything out there. Great bar and a good selection of wines by the glass. French brasserie food at lunch/brunch with excellent saiads, soups, and quiches in addition to sandwiches. It's expensive but high quality. The steaks are pricey but good. If I had a choice between paying for the Gordon Ramsay name at the steakhouse on the other side of the casino and getting a steak here, I'd probably eat my steak here because it seems less pretentious.

To wait for our table instead of wanting out front. :/  When our name was called we had the coolest waiter with so much knowledge of wine and food.

We also enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon made it is made with beef cheeks a part of beef usually thrown away but so soft and tender and the flavor is amazing.\n\nThey do take pride in the food served here and the servers have tons of knowledge to share in wine pairing.

  "text" : "Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day and had a great time.\n\nThe Food: \n\nI would give the food 4 1/2 stars.  The warm baguette they give you to start was delicious.  We ordered the Warm Brie for our appetizer and really enjoyed the whole dish.  The Brie comes with three large croutons and you can use your baguette to finish it up.  This was my first time getting French Onion Soup and I'm hooked.  It was perfectly cheesy and didn't taste watered down like some yelpers have commented.  For our entrees, my girlfriend and I both ordered the flat steaks with frites.  She got the classique which has a seasoned butter topping while I got the bordelaise - carmelized onion/red wine topping.  My steak was perfectly cooked and a lot thicker than some have commented.  They did go a little overboard with the onion topping.  I wouldn't order that one again.  My girlfriend's on the other hand had just a tiny scoop of butter.  Her steak was chewier than mine as she got unlucky with a piece that had a fatty/cartilage line that ran through her whole steak.  The frites were good and the dishes overall were good.  We ordered a side of brussel sprouts and bacon which were good.  For dessert, we got the pineapple bread pudding.  It was flavorful but would not order it again.  Too heavy.  And it was more like pineapple french toast than bread pudding.\n\nThe Service:\n\nThe service overall was average.  I would give it a 3.  It was better in the first half of our meal and got worse through the night.  Water refills came quick, but the person refilling waters did not refill anything else.  So it was always a long wait for the server to bring by a new soda, etc.  The table was bussed quickly until we were done with our entrees.  We probably waited 15 min after we were done before our waiter came by to see if we wanted dessert.  The server was just ok.  Not too friendly.  I know that waiters hate holidays like Valentine's Day because people linger.  But we are actually quick eaters and could have shaved off 20-30 minutes with more attentive service.  \n\nThe Atmosphere:\n\nCheck-in was pretty easy and there was just a short wait for our table.  We decided not to request a patio table, as we didn't want to endure the 1 1/2 hour wait.  We figured we could try for a patio at brunch some time.  The restaurant manages to be crowded and loud while still being romantic.  I prefer this over a quiet restaurant where you can hear everything the people next to you are talking about.  \n\nOverall, this place was good.  We enjoyed this far more than the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  We will definitely return to try the brunch.  We'd probably only come back for dinner on a special occasion."

  "text" : "We went on Friday, 2/15/13.  Unfortunately, the highlight of the evening was the bar.  We had a short wait until our table was ready, so we had a drink.  The bartender was very friendly.\n\nOnce seated, I opted to start with the escargots and my wife went with the onion soup.  We were both pleased with our selections, good but not awe inspiring.\n\nFor the main course, I selected steak roquefort and my wife opted for beef short ribs.  The short ribs we very good, but the steak was mediocre at best.  It was stringy and tough.  I mentioned this to the server, and she told me, \"that is the type of steak it is\".  I wasn't expecting dry aged prime beef for my $25, but I wasn't expecting it to be on par with Applebees either.  \n\nHowever, the real reason for the two star rating was dessert.  I abstained, but my wife choose the bananas foster.  The server smiled and went on her way, (important point later).  Shortly thereafter a plate was delivered to our table was somewhat resembled  a banana foster, but just somewhat.  My wife remained positive, only stating, \"I guess its not flambe\".  On her first bite she gave me a disgusted look and said it was cold, all of it was cold, including the sauce.  I tried the sauce and it was shocked.  It was a cold, thin caramel sauce.  No liqueur or rum and it wasn't even room temperature, but COLD.  UGH.\n\nI stopped a manager and told him about the dessert.  He responded that that is how they prepare the dish and that it couldn't be 'warm', since it contained ice cream.  Really, even Dairy Queen can pull off a hot fudge sundae!?  I said that we've had the dish several times, but have never had it cold and most often is it prepared flambe.  He then went on to say that it was ILLEGAL to do tableside flambe in Las Vegas.  He asked if we remembered the MGM, (now Ballys) fire and said that the fire was caused by a tableside flambe and since then no Las Vegas restaurant can do it.  \n\nWTF!?  This is a flat LIE.  The fire was caused by an electrical problem and exacerbated by construction that allowed the fire to travel rapidly through the ceiling before even being noticed.  My wife and I have have (and seen) tableside flambe at Las Vegas restaurants, so this too is a lie.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't waste my time arguing with such a dishonest person.  I told him to take the dessert back, remove it from our tab and have the check delivered so we could settle up and leave. \n\nWhen she brought the bill, our server apologized that we weren't happy with our dessert and said, \"this happens, people are used to it being prepared differently\".  WHAT?!  Why didn't she advise us of this when we ordered the dish?  Very disappointing."

It's really hard to miss with their gorgeous sidewalk cafe with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. My family and I ate here for our little brother's birthday. I have to give them a lot of credit for service because we gave them an almost impossible feat. Due to poor time management on our part, we had a little over an hour before we had to get to our show. Our server somehow managed to expedite our food and we were able to get to our show on time. \n\nWe started with the classic Caesar Salad and their house bread which came with some carrot slaw. I actually didn't care for it much. It was really ordinary and I've definitely had better at a much lower caliber restaurant. The bread was good though and so was the carrot slaw that came with it. For our entrees, we ordered the Fish and Chips, the Cheeseburger with frites, and Roasted Chicken. Sounds like ordinary dishes but they were executed perfectly. Everything was seasoned nicely, and cooked right. The fish was really good. Probably the best piece of fish I've had at a restaurant. My little brother enjoyed his chicken dish and pretty much inhaled it. I think the frites here are pretty special. I haven't had fries quite like these before. Thin and perfectly crispy. Loved them. \n\nI want to come back and have a longer meal next time. Come check it out because it's well worth the money. Next time,  brunch it is! 4/5"

They have outside seating right on the Strip - great for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains show.  HOWEVER:\n1.  You can't reserve a table outside - you can get put on a list and it may be a long one.\n2.  Despite heaters and misters, it gets hot or cold and you may want to reconsider if the outside air temperature is under 60 or over 100 (during the day, over 90).\nIf you sit insider, where most of the tables are located, it is crowded and fairly noisy.  Some of the cushion style seats are uncomfortable, particularly if you have to sit on a seam between cushions.\n\nThe service is friendly and knowledgeable, but they are always in a rushs.  This is not the place for a leisurely dinner.\n\nOne word about the food, which is uniformly good:  the steaks frites are superior."

I opted for the peppercorn sauce, which had a slight kick and complemented (not overpowered) the meat. Pretty generous portions, but I still finished the whole thing!\n\nWe dined on the patio that sits right next to the Strip, overlooking the beautiful Bellagio waterfront. We basked in the warm glow of the heat lamps that still kept us comfortable in the 48 degree weather. \n\nMy friend subbed out her frites for a side of green beans and they forgot, but they let us keep the frites they brought out anyway, which was nice.

Really nice view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit outside or luck out in the room that we had inside.\n\nWait was not too bad if you wanted to sit inside but prepare to wait if you want to sit outside. What kinda sucked was the service. I don't mind paying paying the standard 18% service fee but can it at least be decent? Numerous times I had to ask for water and it was annoying that the waiter filled up my cup with ice and made me wait the whole time.\n\nAnyways, off to the food. I ordered the French Onion Soup to start off and it was good and I suggest that you share it with a friend or two since I couldn't finish it. Main course for me was the steak bordelaise. It was decent, I had better expectations for this place and it wasn't really up there at the end.\n\nHad a bite of the scallops and it was pretty good if not the best thing I had there. One last thing I forgot about this meal is if you do not like super salty food don't come here! Overall it was an a-okay meal and if you really want a dank steak on the strip head over to Bouchon. I'm not sure if I'll come back here unless it's dinner."

I know all my friends always stop here, so I just HAD to check it out.\n\nAnyway, we came here for breakfast on a Friday morning around 10:30. The patio looked full when we got there, however, we got seated right away! It was low 60s, maybe mid 60s, but the heated patio made it an absolutely amazing experience! Our table was directly across the Bellagio fountains, so not only were we enjoying the delicious food and great weather, but we also had a fantastic view! At that moment, life could not get any better ;-)\n\nI ordered a mimosa and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. I don't know if it was the mimosa, or just my mood, but it was THE BEST Benedict I have ever eaten ANYWHERE! mmm... My boyfriend had the ham & cheese crepes which he also said were amazing. Our server was very attentive and was super pleasant, so no complaints there! The prices were absolutely reasonable considering the fact that it is Vegas after all.\n\nI know there is a M A G in Chicago which I will def check out soon, but nothing beats this Mon Ami Gabi's location on the strip...

Located across from the Bellagio fountains, you get a great view if you sit on the patio. You have to wait list it at the front for the patio, you can't reserve ahead of time like for inside the restaurant.  On a Saturday night in January, we waited for around 30 minutes for a table for two.  Not too bad, as there's a lot of things to see and do in the casino while you're waiting.\n\nI've had the steak frites here, the seared scallops, the prime rib (was on their special menu) and their fish of the day.  Everything I tried was always delicious.  The mini baguette comes out fresh and it's so good we got an extra order!  \n\nA severely underrated dish here is the Duck Confit! Omg, this was hands down my favorite thing on the menu.  It's just one duck leg and thigh, but could definitely serve as a main course and was amazing with it's crisp skin, juicy meat, and was so flavorful. I've come here three times, and will probably keep coming back, because despite all the offerings that Vegas has, this is hands down one of the best deals around."

  "text" : "On my recent trip to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi stood out as not only the most delicious and memorable restaurant, but probably the most bang for your buck.\n\nWhile it was a Sunday night, we decided to err on the side of caution and make a reservation. Good call, it was pretty busy! We were quickly seated by a friendly hostess and our server brought us a great, crusty baguette and an amuse bouche, which was a pickled carrot. While I enjoyed the pickled carrot, the bread was what really stood out. It was everything I wanted and more. It was so perfect to sop up all of the sauce for the appetizer we ordered (escargot). So, I don't have snail very often, but I always order it when I see it on a menu and I have to say the escargot at Mon Ami was exceptional. It was cooked very nicely and wasn't chewy (sometimes it feels like I'm eating a rubber band when I order escargot). The sauce was buttery and garlicky, and as I mentioned, every drop of sauce went to good use when sopped up with the perfect bread.\n\nFor an entree, I had the braised lamb shank which was not only a huge portion, but was ridiculously moist and tender. The meat was completely falling off the bone and was flawlessly seasoned. Best of all, the sides were also solid. Couscous, almonds, raisins, and root vegetables. The sweet chewiness of the raisins paired well with the crunch of the almonds and the earthy caramelization on the vegetables. My dinning companion had the poisson frites, which were also exceptional. The frites consisted of a huge filet of white fish that was delicately coated and fried. Don't order this if you are expecting fish and chips, because this is far superior. The coating was crunchy but understated and the frites were practically paper thin and were airy. \n\nThroughout the visit service was friendly and attentive, and I rather enjoyed the ambiance. \n\nThe best part? The bill. An appetizer, two entrees, a few cocktails and beer.... less than $100. In a city where Starbucks charges over $5 for an americano, I was expecting more damage considering the high quality and huge portion. It was one of the cheapest meals of the trip and it was by far the most delicious. I cannot recommend it enough!"

Out came half a cantaloupe, all diced up like a flower (pretty!) with a couple chunks of pineapple stuffed in between. I felt kinda ripped off since I was expecting a bigger variety of fruit. It was really hard to cut into the cantaloupe flower as well and it was an overload on cantaloupe. Definitely don't get this...huge rip off. The yogurt side was very creamy and the mint syrup was very light and refreshing though.\n\nGluten free toast: Tasted like real toast! The jam was very delicious (homemade?) and I actually enjoyed the toast very much...even if it was slightly over toasted.\n\nMushroom omelette: Full of flavor, but it was much too simplistic. Boyfriend said he could've made it at home for half the price with even more eggs!\n\nEgg white omelette: It was pure egg white, nothing else. No veggies or extra ingredients...my friend was very disappointed in it. \n\nOverall, Mon Ami Gabi's food is executed well and visually appealing, but it's really lacking in the little twists and \"Oh!\"s that make food EXCITING! In other words, although delicious, the restaurant is a bit too safe in terms of food options, and it'd be nice to see them add an interesting flavor twist or flair into their items (ex: Putting ingredients into their egg white omelette).\n\nPS: My friend got the french toast and LOVED IT.

Service is absolutely fantastic, I also reccomend sitting in the patio.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorite stops in Las Vegas, definitely returning during my next trip."

  "text" : "If there's something I developed a taste for over the last couple of years, it is definitely French cuisine. My girlfriend loves everything French, especially the food. I decided to take her here for our two year anniversary and I can't say that my expectations weren't met. The menu isn't a run-on book, it's a one page array of all things tasty. Les Poissons (hee hee hee, hah hah hah) looked and smelled fantastic. The wine was affordable per glass. We ordered the \"Frangria,\" the French version of Sangria which was quite the punch.\n\nI have this weird sense of things where I judge a place I eat by what they give you for free, in this case the bread. Naturally, we sat down and were greeted with a French baguette accompanied by some delicious butter and an amuse bouche, which was some kind of pickled apple concoction. The bread was delicious, it's lead me to one of those moments where I said \"I could just come here for the bread\" and this was no lie. All of that was delicious. We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\n\nI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise. My beef wellington was.....nucking futs delicious. I've always wanted to try a wellington and oh my gosh was it delicious. The beef was tender and succulent, cooked just the way I like it. The generous portion of beef was surrounded by a puff pastry which was to die for. The wellington was served with a sautéed spinach and garlic side, which was on point. I tried some of the steak my girlfriend ordered and it was, you may as well write the rest of this, AMAZING. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were just enough to get me  full to the brim. \n\nTo make matters \"worse,\" we order the Bananas Fosters Crepes for dessert. Gluttony became our ruler at this point as we shoveled this behemoth of a dessert down our bellies completely satisfied with the meal as a whole. My only gripe was that our waitress was a little inattentive once we got our food. As we didn't see her from the moment we got our food till we were done, looking around for her to come by. Regardless, that would not be the deciding factor if I come back because I definitely will. \n\nGentleman, if you have a date and you want to impress her, go on and take her here. We sat inside but I hear the patio is just as nice. This is a great place for tourists and LOCALS alike."

This place has all of these things and is also super accommodating to people with allergies and dietary restrictions. I've never been to a French restaurant with a gluten-free menu, yet they had it! The chef also wrote somewhere on one of the menus that they are happy to accommodate people with any allergy, so just say the word. \n\nWe started with the out of this world duck confit and fingerling potato appetizer, along with the butter lettuce and arugula salad. For dinner the server recommended the filet mignon, which was mouth watering, as promised. I also got the frangria and a nicely paired glass of red wine. My partner got the chicken paillard, which was good initially but got cold and dry fast. We took the chicken leftovers and made some pretty delicious sandwiches with it the next day.\n\nSpeaking of bread, they brought me out some slices of some yummy gluten-free bread at the beginning of the meal, which made me a lot less resentful of my partner's warm baguette."

Although the sitting area was beautiful overlooking the bellagio and passersby, my husband and I were not impressed with our selections.  He got the chicken, Brie, and apple crepe which he said was flavorless.  The crepe itself was nearly empty.  Hecalao asked for fries on the side and ended up getting potato sticks/chips so dont order fries if you're expecting regular fries. I got the three eggs breakfast and my eggs were overcooked and the hashbrowns  were nothing to rave about.  One thing that turned me off immediately and the reason for my 2 star rather than 3 star rating was the distinct eggy/dirty smell that was surrounding us even before we received our meal.  I would pass on this place on my next trip to LV."

I like my seafood crepe although it was a bit on the heavier side and it was a bit too creamy...and my friend's ham and cheese crepe was a bit too salty in my opinion.

Anyways, the fish was pretty bland and was not very pretty either (I could pan fry a fish way better than that). I'll upload a picture later.\n\nThe waiter was a bit uninterested (Abraham).

So as much as I wanted to try the steak au poivre, I decided on the rib eye after finding out that the steak dishes are just top sirloin pounded flat. Boy! 22oz rib eye was delicious!!! I cleaned the meat off the bone! It came with bearnadaise sauce made with egg (like hollandaise), but it did not need it at all.

  "text" : "Service is always sub-par.  Recently went for Sunday Brunch to sit on the patio, where the first impression of the experience was waiting over 5 minutes for the hostess to figure out what to do with the guest in front of us.  As she \"shoo'd\" the guest away, there wasn't a \"good morning, welcome to Mon Ami Gabi\", in fact there wasn't any greeting coming out of the her mouth, just a blank stare waiting for me to say \"2 people please\".  Is there a point when management just doesn't care or forget to train the host or hostess to be hospitable?  Last time I checked, restaurants are in the hospitality business...  \n\nIf anyone has ever been to Mon Ami Gabi, its a busy restaurant, our hostess that sat us never made any eye contact or cared to start up a conversation, as the walk to the patio is a good minute.  It was a crowded day and hostess pushed through guests charging her way through the dining room, literally loosing us by the time she got out to the patio.\n\nI figured our experience was about to turn around, or at least hoped.  Anyway, sitting on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi, people watching on a nice Sunday morning, your experience will be good even if the food and service can't compliment the location.\n\nOur busser was friendly and prompt, he came by and made sure our waters and coffees where filled at all times, with a smile.  Our Server on the other hand must have been trained by the same person lacking a hospitable drop of service that trained the hostesses.  My friend had been to Mon Ami Gabi only a few weeks earlier for brunch and she remembered an omelette she had that consisted of ham, mushrooms and blue cheese.  She mentioned this to the server and his response was \"huh\".  After hearing my friend rave about this omelette all morning, I kind of assumed that the server would say, \"please allow me check if we have any blue cheese, I'm sure the chef would be more than happy to make that for you.\" but rather a \"huh\" response.  So we start to order our meals, in the middle of writing down our order, he tells us he'll be right back and goes and talks with his busser and another table for a few minutes.  What a way to make the guest feel important...  He certainly must have needed our table, as he sat the check down before our breakfast plates were cleared - I would have had no problem ordering some baguette and nutella or a pastry with the rest of my coffee, but I guess increasing our check wasn't part of his thought process.  Funny thing is, I had my credit card on top of the check presenter for over 15 minutes before he came by to pick it up - So I guess, he wasn't trying to rush us out - he just wanted to take a break, as we didn't see him for a long time...\n\nWhatever the case - there just isn't too many restaurants in Vegas with such a prime location, where you can eat outside and people watch.  If there was, I would never come back and the restaurant would have been rated 1 star, but due to great ambiance, with no help from the staff,  I gave it 3 star"

He had a weird attitude from the moment we sat down.  :(\nWhile the food was good, I ordered a cosmo along with the ladies I work with and it was made with a lemon vodka for sure.  It also had lemon pieces in it from being squeezed, which made it lemony and not a cosmo.  He tried to argue with me about it but whatever, I just got a plain vodka and cranberry up.

For brunch, get a cappuccino in a bowl and enjoy the eggs Benedict or one of the crêpes.\n\nI've been to Mon Ami Gabi several times: an early dinner, a late dinner, and brunch. The first and last example had great service. In the late dinner, there were lots of diners and the service was a weak for a while, but recovered in time for dessert. Prices are, well, to be expected for this prime real estate on the Strip. Trust me, you can do worse.

My boyfriend who accompanied me on the trip agreed. We love dining out and are self-proclaimed foodies who will try most things but also enjoy classics just as much as the next person. We also will order different things and share in order to enjoy variety during meals. The entire experience of dining is something we are both fairly passionate about.\n\nI ordered the bananas foster skinny pancakes, a half order of the blueberry french toast, and bf ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. Definitely too much food for the two of us but we couldn't decide and had absolutely no regrets. I also ordered the cappuccino in a bowl - couldn't resist, but probably overkill for one person (bf doesn't like coffee). All the food was out of this world good. We went on February 23rd and now that I am writing this review I am salivating thinking about those darn skinny pancakes. How I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live!\n\nThe service was exceptional - we had three or four people waiting on our every need. The ambiance is excellent as well. We sat on the patio even though it was in the mid 50s or so, but the heaters they have outside made it perfectly comfortable. Next time we are in Vegas we will DEFINITELY return. It is a bit pricey which is about the only reason we didn't go back every morning (that and wanting to try other things). Normally we would not be too thrilled about spending $40 for two for breakfast, but for the amount and quality of food, it was more than worth the price. As far as breakfast goes, nothing else we had in Vegas (or possibly anywhere) compares to Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nHighly recommend making a reservation, even for breakfast."

This dining experience would have been disappointing if I'd spent $10. The fact that my entree set me back $25 was just painful.\n\nThe only real reason to dine at Mon Ami Gabi is if you snag an outdoor table in order to people watch and take in the Bellagio fountain across the street. Perhaps stick with a cup of onion soup and bread to avoid the inevitable case of the crankies when you feel like you've been culinarily flipped the bird and price gouged."

Here's what we ordered:\n\n- Escargots de Bourgogne (oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) - pretty good\n\n- Housemade Country Pate (cornichons, whole grain mustard, warm country bread) - a LOT of pate, too little bread, I liked this dish, but talk about disparity b/t the two.\n\n- Chicken Liver Mousse (burgundy red wine mustard, toasted brioche) - same as above, with respect to mousse to bread ratio - too much mousse, too little bread.  I was looking forward to this dish, but that burgundy red wine mustard is just nasty and overpowering), pass!\n\n- Sea Scallops Gratinees (caramelized fennel & onion marmalade, mussel cream) - thin scallops that were tasty, but surrounded by too much cheese.  Should have gone with the entree version instead, sigh...\n\n- Rack of Lamb Special - overpowering mustard sauce on the lamb that was just unpleasant.  The lamb was tender and the au jus was tasty.  Excise the sauce and it is  tasty, but $36 worth of tasty?  No.\n\n- Creme Brulee - this was the best dish of the night, nice and creamy with the right thickness to the sugary top."

  "text" : "One of our favorite breakfast places on the strip.  There is a 35 minute wait if you want outside (highly recommended, mostly in the shade, right on the street for people watching, Bellagio fountains go off across the street) but they do pagers so that is way better than someone yelling your name in a loud lobby area.  Inside the glass area is also nice as it is bright but loud.  The restaurant itself is dark since this is a steakhouse so not the best for breakfast.  Tip: Make a reservation before you leave and have less of a wait.\n\nChampagne Framboise is a great sparkling cocktail and mixed perfectly to not have too much  flavor overpowering the sparkling wine.\n\nThe week we went they had an eggs benedict special with brisket.  Great dish, hollandaise sauce is light and not overpowering.  Sometimes one of the two poached eggs comes medium or almost hard so if that bothers you send it back.  Muffin is good, not heavy and grilled nicely.\n\nAlso had the corned beef hash and poached eggs.  The corned beef is not so much a hash as it is corned beef cabbage minus the cabbage.  To me this is a good thing as when it comes cubed or the normal mushy hash it is dry as the potatoes are mixed in.  Here, the potatoes are separate from the meat so it stays moist and juicy.  And poached eggs (you can order the eggs any style) only make it better.\n\nThe brisket that came with the benedict looked almost the same as the corned beef but the taste was very different between the two so don't think they are just using the same meat for everything.  We could have both dishes over and over and enjoy them every time.\n\nTable service was always excellent, food came fast (which is preferred for breakfast)."

Hidden inside Paris's casinos is this fine venue. Lines can be long, so one should make reservations. Inside seating is very intimate. Patio seating is a very scenic atmosphere. You can't go wrong with either.\n\nWhenever I'm at a French restaurant, ordering escargot for hor'dourves is a must. Be sure to try their Shellfish platter. At $44 for a whole lobster, four oysters, and four shrimp with amazing sauces, this platter is too good to be true. The specials are also amazing. Two words: Duck meringe. A glass of wine from the cart goes well with your meal."

They knew that we had just been married in Vegas 48 hours before and treated us like VIPs. Definitely not required but was so nice.\nWe had champagne and dessert on the house but ordered the onion soup, steak with bleu cheese and the seafood platter to share. Nothing short of amazing. The ambiance makes you truly feel like you're in France- staring at the Bellagio fountains was the icing on the cake. \nDefinitely make a reservation as it is QUITE popular.\nWorth every penny."

It would've been nice to sit outside in the patio which has a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, the wait for outside was like an hour or more.  I wonder if you can request an outside table while making a reservation.  Maybe we'll try that next time.\n\nOk, let's get to the food.  They serve a delicious crusty french baguette with butter at your table once you are seated.  We didn't order any appetizers because we wanted to fill up on the main course - STEAK!  I ordered the Steak Bearnaise and my fiance ordered the Steak Bourdelaise.  The bearnaise sauce was nice, smooth, and creamy and tasted soooo good together with the steak.  The bourdelaise was a delicious red wine sauce with caramelized onions.  Both steaks were served with their hand-cut fries.  Their fries are unique in the way they're cut.  They're flat and wide and fried nice and crispy.  This is one of our favorite restaurants and will definitely make this a place to come to every time we're in Vegas."

As for price, it ran us about $350.00 for 5 people to have a full 3 course dinner with wine. We had not seen each other so we spent well over two hours talking and socializing during our dinner. This was one of the best evenings we all spent together in Las Vegas. It is a lot of food, but take your time and have the soup, main course, and desert. Desert is hard to order when your full, but it is absolutely amazing here!\n\nThe wait staff did a great job taking care of us. We were never once interrupted and even with a busy place they took their time with us explaining everything as well as giving us the felling there was no hurry take your time. The most amazing thing, was that we thought our waitress did such a good job we tipped her very well. She came running after us to make sure that we understood that we had given a large trip. After we explained that yes we did that intentionally she thanked us and wished us a good night."

Luckily we had them on a Saturday night as the line was long for hours. The host's were great and very accommodating.

All were delicious. I wish I had room for dessert. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars i because of service.

The best seating though is on the patio where you get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and just a splendid ambiance overall. \n\nThe bread basket is delicious. I think the bread they serve is one of the most important determining factors as to whether or not you will get a great meal. I have tried the Escargots de bourgogne. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was actually really good! It was seasoned with garlic-herb butter. For dinner I had the Steak au poivre. It was nothing less than amazing. \n\nTo pair with dinner I ordered their french sangria, known as \"Frangria\" which is absolutely divine. I wasn't able to try out their dessert so that is something I'll have to look into on my next visit. I am also really looking forward to trying out their breakfast meals after hearing great things about it.

  "text" : "I came here on Sunday with my sisters and well lets just say if I think French, I think really good savory crepes. Well to my surprise it wasn't that great. There wasn't much of a selection to begin with. So I settled with the chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe. First bite I thought it was me thinking it was so salty. Comes to find out it was just the broccoli that is seasoned to salty. We also order the tuna melt sandwich. I don't know about you but when I order a tuna sandwich anything I expect it not to be fishy. I'm sorry I have to say was way too fishy for my liking. It was so bad the waiter notice we were not fond of it and took it off our bill. So she made up for the lack of not being so attentive with refilling our drinking or bring out more bread. But the thing that was good was the hand cut fries. Very thin and crispy just like potato chips  also the one thing that I did love besides the fries was there special! The Shaved Beef and Brie Sandwich with Sun-Dried Tomato Aioli. This was to die for! It was the perfect amount to have so you can last until dinner time. It doesn't sit heavy when you are done either which is a plus on my book. I would come back to mon ami gabi just for that. If we didn't order that I would never step foot back here.\n\nAlso a little side note, for some reason the hosts are not so friendly. Waiters inside are a little better. When the host took us inside to get seated I had on high boots so I have to walk slow cause of the tile floors they have are a little slippery. One of the waiter push be faster to walk cause she forgot someone order making me almost trip... Just saying don't wear heels here ladies."

I opted for the indoor seating, resigning myself to a darkened room on a nice spring day, but their indoor dining area is actually open to the patio - so it's like you're sitting on the patio anyway, just with less of a breeze ruffling your napkins and stuffs.\n\nOn to the food. VERY fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced (~$11-20 a plate? with a LOT of food on that plate) (go figure, for a Vegas fixture). Brunch is definitely the best meal to have here - they have a whole selection of yummy egg choices, omelettes and Eggs Benedict, but they have equally delicious waffles, savory choices, and even healthier options like oatmeal or egg white omelettes. I got the turkey egg white omelette with avocado (feeling guilty from indulging in M Resort's buffet the day before) and it hit the spot just right. I'm definitely coming back here!"

This place gets PACKED!\nCome around 6PM, and ask for an outside seat! You'll have dinner just in time for the music and water show in front of the Bellagio!\n\nCame here for my sister's bday dinner with a party of 5. Put in our reservations ahead of time, and still had to wait about a good 10 minutes (so I decided to play the slot machines outside and won $50! The wild safari animals one with big cats.)\n\nWe were seated, and the waiters immediately brought water, bread and butter. it was so delicious, and the warm bread tasted just as fresh and as when I was in Paris. After putting in our orders, one of the waiters spilled a flask of water behind us and apologized! We didn't even care nor did the water splash on us. But within a few minutes, he brought an appetizer FREE of charge! :D Our waiter was also french! Or maybe he just pretended to have a french accent, but he was really on top of it, and made nice conversation on our meal, day, and Vegas trip. \n\nAppetizers Ordered: Escargot, scallops, and oysters! Oysters were really fresh with the lemon! Escargot also as excellent as when I ate them in Paris! Scallops were a little small, but still thoroughly enjoyable and delicious to eat.\n\nWine: Ordered a merlot and it was excellent! Tasted so well with our dinner.\n\nMain Course: I ordered the salmon with rice. I thought it looked a little small to be honest, and the salmon a bit overcooked. But the rice was excellent, and salmon still pretty fresh and enjoyable. Not the most amazing salmon I've ever had, but it did its job.\n\nAll while eating dinner, the Bellagio had its water show and the night was perfect!

But the real surprise for me was the attentiveness of the service and the quality of the food.  \n\nWe arrived a little late for our reservation and the hostesses went out of their way to accommodate us even though the restaurant was packed.  We got lucky and were given a prime table on the patio.  This is really the way to go if you plan to dine at the Mon Ami Gabi.  Keep in mind that they take reservations for the inside of the restaurant but not for the patio.  Most evenings you can expect to wait at least an hour and a half to get a table on the patio.  If you have time to kill (or get lucky like we did), this is well worth it.  It's like dining on a street corner in Paris with an incredible water show every 15 minutes.  If you want to stick w/ a reserved time, the interior decor is very refined w/ dark woods and classic French accents.\n\nSteak and frittes are the plat du jour and our meal was served hot, perfectly cooked and delicious.  The blue cheese version was mouth wateringly good.  Steak was pounded thin, but even so, our medium rare request was met.\n\nOur server was friendly and enthusiastic without being overbearing.  She made the experience even better.  \n\nPrices are surprisingly reasonable considering Vegas' notoriously inflated menu costs.\n\nEnjoy!"

The people we met said to make reservations and it's a piece of cake to get in so we did and it was.  There was a huge crowd at the door but if you have a reservation there is a separate hostess stand and you just walk right up.  We were seated within a couple of minutes and really lucked out to have a table that was inside but we could see the fountain at the Bellagio.  \n\nWithin minutes of being seated we were offered water and they brought a bagette of bread in a nice paper wrapping.  When you finish that you just crush up the wrapper and another loaf magically appears.  Then along comes our server who asks if we would like something to drink besides water.  Since I wanted wine, she rolls up this huge cart with probably 15 bottles to choose from, all French of course.  She let me taste several before I made my decision which was pretty cool.\n\nHubby had a steak with frites, which are way different than our fries but really good.  I had scallops that came with a puree of some type of veggie, can't remember what, and roasted brussel sprouts.\n\nWould have given this five stars but we each ordered salads which were basically lettuce with nothing else and pricey at that.  Sorry we didn't have room for dessert but plan on going back for breakfast next time."

  "text" : "If I could give Mon Ami Gabi ten stars here, I would. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We chose them as the venue for our wedding reception. We booked the Private Dining Room, which can hold up to 30 people (though I would cap it at 24 as they suggest).  Here are the reasons we rate Mon Ami so highly:\n\n- Impeccable customer service from management - We worked with Drew to arrange our reception and Chris oversaw our event on the actual night of our wedding. From seating plan, to food allergy accommodations to media (LCD projector and screen) to every other detail...they worked with us and were proactive to make sure we did not have to change any of our desired reception plans.  They fully accommodated us with all the friendliness and sincerity that we have a good wedding.\n\n- Impeccable customer service from the wait staff - Elizabeth and Jonathan were the servers assigned to our reception of 22 people. Mon Ami Gabi also assigned a busser. You could tell the staff enjoyed their work. They were so pleasant and fun. They met and on so many occasions surpassed our every need during our wedding reception.  For example, they cut and boxed slices of wedding cake for our guests to take back to their rooms and even helped us pack items that came home with us. It was just so easy to work with them and a real pleasure. We tipped them far above the mandatory 20% gratuity.\n\n- Phenomenal food. Large portions. Our guests raved.\n\n- Beautiful views from the Private Dining Room.\n\n- Audio control. Music filters throughout the restaurant, but the staff was able to turn down the speakers directly above our room.\n\nWith 22 guests and the staff circulating and a screen set up, the room was a bit cramped. Also, the room was warm and unfortunately, the casino regulates the temperature not Mon Ami Gabi, But was still had the perfect reception.  I have no regrets, just so happy with the experience Mon Ami Gabi provided for our wedding."

  "text" : "This is a cute little place located in Paris. You definitely want to take advantage sitting in the patio on a nice, sunny day. It might be a little wait though. We had to wait around 30 minutes. Totally worth it.\n\nThe food here is typically priced from around $10-25. I ordered the french onion soup. It was a decent size. My soup had a nice cheesy crust over the top. And they were definitely generous with the cheese. Cheese = happiness. I like that bit a lot. The bread that was under the cheese was a bit too oversaturated with the soup and mushy. It's a personal preference kind of thing, but i really do not like mushy, slimy things. Overall the soup was decent, a bit pricey for a French Onion Soup though, $10. For $10 it could have been better. \n\nMy friend got steak au poivre. I think she ordered it rare, but when I taste tested her food, it seemed more medium rare to medium. I thought the meat was on the tough side. But my friend had no complaints. She moreso loved the flavor of the meat and sauce. The steak was huge too. So i guess she did get her money's worth for a dish that cost $25.95. \n\nAnother friend i was with got the Big Skinny lemon pancakes, or something of the sort. They were thin pancakes, a bit thicker than crepes, slathered with lemon butter and syrup (i think). I had a small bite. It was pretty good. My friend seemed to like it just fine. He still ate all of it despite this being his second meal in the morning. \n\nOverall, I think this is a cute place to stop buy and have a nice brunch on a pretty, sunny day with friends. The food was okay, in my taste. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was an unforgettable experience. I was not wowwed or anything but It was cute! if sitting on the patio under the sun is your thang, then do your thang at Mon Ami Gabi."

It fell right off the bone. Neither one of us are a cherry fan, but we liked the cherries that came with this appetizer.\n\nFor the entree, I had the classic steak and fries. The fries were very thin and crisp, almost like fry chips. I enjoyed these a lot. I ordered my steak medium, but it wasn't pink at all. However, still tender. The steak, in my opinion, was just okay. I would not pay $25 for it again. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the patty melt. He likes almost everything in the world, but did not enjoy this meal at all. The party melt came with a thousand island dressing, which he hates. I can't recall if it said this on the menu....\n\nThe bread that they serve is just like in France. It was warm and crisp, even the butter was delicious.\n\nThe service was very good, our server's name was Katherin. Our waters were constantly being filled.\n\nI loved the environment. It was super windy today so we sat inside near a window, right by the bar.\n\nI would come back, but next time I would like to try breakfast."

Needless to say, excellent people watching out on the porch.\n\nOur waiter was FABULOUS and I am kicking myself for forgetting his name.  Super handsome man, too ;)  His presentation of the specials convinced me to get a special Eggs Benedict with spinach and mushrooms.  My fiancé chose French Onion Soup and a croissant.  Because, as our waiter so eloquently put it \"You're in Vegas, you can do whatever you want!\"  French Onion Soup at 7 am?! Why not!

His sister-in-law used to continually rave about this place and after months of waiting, we decided that our anniversary would the perfect date. \n\nI don't know why but for some reason, we decided not to make reservations. Foolish, foolish idea. You most definitely should make a reservation. We waited for about 40 minutes and finally got seated in a table made for two. Seeing that my boyfriend is a 6'2\", 200lb man, let's just say that the table was just a bit on the tiny side.\n\nWe were greeted by a curly haired waitress-- she was terrific! She first started us off with some bread and butter to accompany my glass of Merlot and my boyfriend's glass of Cotes du Rhone. I know that he enjoyed his wine but it definitely didn't compare to the most smooth and soft bodied Merlot I have ever tasted. Mmmm, soooo good!\n\nWe went on to order the warm brie cheese as our appetizer. Oh this is so very, very good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but I decided to order this for my cheese-loving man. Good thing because I couldn't stop my hands from reaching for the platter! The croutons gave such a nice crunch and the slightest bit of saltiness to contrast the soft and gooey, sweet honey-covered cheese. I swear I think this is the only appetizer we'll ever order here!\n\nFor the main, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon au poivre and I ordered the filet mignon merlot. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection, juicy and well seasoned. However, we both agreed that t the end of the day, mine was much more flavorful due to the merlot reduction. Either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and it went well with our steak, although it had too much black pepper for our taste.\n\nWith the help of many hours of Masterchef Australia, I became familiar with different types of french desserts and was extremely excited to order profiteroles... until I saw the chocolate fudge cake with homemade caramel ice cream, that is. We ended up ordering the chocolate cake which was beyond incredible. Then, our kick ass waitress sensed much hesitation from me and brought out some profiteroles--on the house! Score! :D Needless to say, it was phenomenal. \n\nObviously, my overall experience was absolutely superb, and I definitely recommend this place for people who are celebrating a wonderful occasion. Just brace yourself- you're gonna want some more real soon!"

Located inside Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, just go inside and hang a left. Myself and two friends dined here for lunch on Sunday 7-April. Most things on the menu looked appetizing and of course Steak Frites is classic French so you can't go wrong there. I had the Prime Steak Sandwich which I enjoyed very much. It came with a side that was a cross between potato chips and french fries. A much lighter option to fries and still tasty. I did try the Steak Frites as a friend ordered it. I would not hesitate to order that item. It was cooked perfectly as was the steak for my sandwich. I washed it  all down with a classic French Beer - Kronenbourg 1664. They of course have a full bar and a fairly extensive wine menu. The wait staff had name tags but the only thing listed was a number which I found odd. Staff-wise they were all friendly and accommodating. Outside seating seems to be a hot commodity but we wanted to sit inside anyway since it was a little warm out there. One oddity was the lack of crepe options. I would have expected a fairly extensive crepe menu for both savory and sweet crepes. I mean, it's all just toppings really. A crepe is a crepe so to limit what your kitchen staff can put inside said crepe seems odd, especially for a French restaurant. Overall it was a great lunch and we would all eat there again. If you are thinking about it, give it a shot."

They give you pager, recommend to walk around and arrive as soon as pager beeps (30-60 min waiting). We arrived and even after that had to wait a long time near doors to get in. Finally we decided to leave.\nNext day we tried again. We were seated. And, truly speaking, nothing special in their food.

Service was OK.. atmosphere very good.. but food, yuk and expensive. The French onion soup (which you would think would be good in a French Restaurant) was so salty we could barely eat it and it was mostly bread, and not the good kind...\nugh."

The portions are on the small side and the prices are high.\n\nI've eaten at Mon Ami Gabi twice- once for lunch and once for dinner.  I would probably choose another restaurant on my next Strip visit.   There are many fabulous restaurants nearby that are a much better value for the money."

But this place offers AFFORDABLE DELICIOUS french cuisine in the most adorable little French setting and includes a gorgeous shaded patio facing the strip, so You d@mn-well better expect there's gonna be a wait.\n\nI had breakfast here and it was the best breakfast I had during my entire trip to Vegas. The breakfast buffet (MGM) I went to another day was crap. Why spend $30+ on scrambled eggs when you can spend half that price on QUALITY cuisine - not average food slurry. House-baked English muffins and baquettes, artfully prepared eggs; extremely well prepared.\n\nThe atmosphere is just awesome. The patio is shaded with big umbrellas, it's facing the strip so it makes for perfect people-watching, AND it's facing the Bellagio fountains. For us, it was the best patio on the strip. Period.  The inside looks like a French cafe and is super cute, but my boyfriend loves to people watch, and this is one of the best places on the strip to do that.\n\nTIP:  You don't want to wait, be there BEFORE 9:30am. We arrived at 10 on Saturday and waited 30 minutes to get on the patio but it was totally worth it. There was no wait if you were willing to eat inside. \n\nWhen I come back to Vegas, this WILL be on the TOP list of places to eat at."

I used the Open Table app on my phone to make reservations and it was easy to alter them if we woke up earlier or later in the morning. I do recommend reservations or going before 9am to avoid a wait. Sitting outside is great, but there are also lots of seats on the patio where you are still basically outside. The inside decor is a little dark so it would be fine for evening dining, but not ideal for breakfast. There is no wait for breakfast inside though so if I was hungry, I'd go for it!\n\nI had the scrambled egg platter both mornings. Eggs cooked perfectly, shredded hash browns, and toasted thick bread. One morning I had bacon, which was the thickest cut bacon ever and was delicious. The other day I opted for sausage, which was great too. My husband had the Quiche Lorraine and an omelet on our second trip and was very happy with his meals too. \n\nService was excellent from the hostess to the manager, servers, etc. Everyone was incredibly friendly. The coffee mugs were tiny, which concerned me, but our mugs were literally refilled every few minutes....it was amazing! I felt the prices were reasonable for Vegas and for the two of us we paid $30-$40 total. If we had been in Vegas longer, I would have loved to try their lunch or dinner."

Right?\n\nSince I gave up mean for Lent (yes, I am a confirmed Catholic) I didn't have too many other choices. I settled for the Egg White Omelette. The omelette is just that, an omelette. So it was good. It comes with a roasted tomato that I cut up & it complimented the omelette & gave it more flavor. Their hash browns weren't too greasy which is sorta hard to come by. It came with a side of toast as well. \n\nEven during busy lunch time & no reservations made, we were ableto get seated in less than 10 mins. Pretty impressive.\n\nAll in all, that entree was actually so good that I decided to order it when we had breakfast before leaving Vegas :) I totally recommend it."

Their \"famous\" steaks w/ various french sauces are all top sirloin, pounded out very thin.  It's mealy (as all top sirloin is) and tastes mushy and bored.  Slathering it a *rendition* of a french sauce helps only slightly.\n\nThey have this beautiful wine cellar and then a totally worthless wine list.  And the good bottles on the list: \"Oh sorry, we're out of that one\". \n\nThis gets me to service.  The staff is NOT trained in fine dining of any sort, and while I know this is not Robuchon, they are missing basic stuff.  They are not attentive, forgetful, and have little knowledge about either the food or wine.  I eventually asked if they had a Somm, she said \"no but the manager was trained in somm\".  I'm being fussy at this point but c'mon, you're at a french restaurant and your waiters are saying things like so and so is \"trained in somm\".\n\nAlso, when waiter got vibe we were less than impressed she avoided us, flat out.  I just wanted my check so I could cut hokey pokey wannabe french restaurant their cut and bounce. \n\nOn the other hand, the table next to us from Nebraska was just raving about everything that hit their plate.

  "text" : "I had dinner here with my two girlfriends and were serendipitously given a table with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Atmosphere was absolute perfection and very romantic. There is quite a bit of a wait (approx 20 mins) even with a reservation so it can be a bit frustrating at first. However, once you are seated, the staff is wonderfully efficient and serve you freshly baked French bread (very tasty) and butter with shredded carrot appetizer (on the house) before you can bat an eyelash. Our entrees were served to us within 5-10 minutes of ordering. Amazing! \n\nI ordered the Steak Au Poivre, which is with the black peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted delicious. Entrees typically come with a mound of thin French fries. We shared a bread pudding, which I cannot remember due to the overconsumption of Sangria that night. But I remember that it was tasty and served a la mode. My most salient memory of this place---they have STRONG sangrias. Order them if you want a nice glow during dinner. \n\nOverall, I really liked this little cafe. It's a bit different from my usual, which is just your average mom and pop hole-in-the-wall shop. But I found it to be nice without being overly pretentious. \n\nTips: Make a reservation because this place is veryyy popular and packed with people on the weekend."

I was told they would give me a window seat, though I did not end up next to a window... ? I was in the patio.

A large quantity! I actually did not finish it.\nAnd I had the au poivre burger, which was cooked to my preference, but a little too salty (they sprinkled large grain salt on the slice of tomato and, it seems, the rest of the plate).\nI barely touched the fries that came with my burger - they were mostly chewey! And a few were hard as rocks! Not sure what all the raves about there.\n\nOverall, the food was alright, but it was such an odd dining experience.

  "text" : "This is one of my mainstay spots, when the sun is out and I want to feel like I have gone out on the town, off I go to Mon Ami Gabi. It really is a combination of the ambiance and the food, how can you go wrong when you are sitting outside, enjoying french food, faced with the spectacular performance of the Bellagio fountains, topped with the shockingly, in-your-face exposure of the best people watching in Las Vegas. I love it! Having worked in the fashion business for years, largely based in New York, I am thoroughly convinced that the true pleasures of Vegas demands that every man and women dig deep into their closet and find that outfit that screams 'take me to Vegas', chosen completely for our entertainment.  Keep in mind, you choose to go at a busy time and want to sit outside, as half the world does in the nice weather, you need to strategically pick that off moment or you will have a long wait. Everyone wants to sit outside. \n\nOk, now lets address the food, it is excellent for the most part. I always seem to order the Steak and Frites Classic and it is delicious, however, my only pet peeve, which I always forget to mention, is that when I ask for the sauce on the side they bring it near frozen. I never get that, I think the obvious thing would be to serve it slightly heated rather then chilled. Well, they never fail to do it and if I can't get my ducks in order to  remember to point that out. By the way, the muscles are to die for. I also recommend that you sign up for their rewards program to earn points. It is worth it as we were just there the other day and I had a $40.00 credit, nice perk, It bought my wine.\n\nI have always had great table service with interesting waiters/waitresses and the busser's are on it. But, it is a hit-miss with the hostess stand. I have this frustration with those holding the 'first' position who cannot look me in the eye and giggle between each other. My experiences have often started with an unpleasant and often somewhat confused hostess. Unlike a tourist, I am a sure thing, as I know what is behind the door, but if I was a visitor there are many occasions where I would simply pass on the wait due to the rude, impersonal interaction with the host. Front desk aside, it is a fantastic spot and great food!!"

  "text" : "We had a beautiful early dinner here on a Saturday night during our Girls' trip to Vegas.  The other ladies had previously been here, and while I have dined at the Eiffel Tower restaurant, I had never been to Mon Ami Gabi.  Who knew you could get such a good view of the Bellagio fountains without actually being at the Bellagio!\n\nObviously you want to eat on the patio.  We made reservations through OpenTable for 4:45 and requested the patio, but then read that the patio is seated in a first come first serve basis, so you can't actually request it ahead of time.  Well luckily for us, they had a table for six, perfectly shaded by an umbrella and seated us just in time for a fountain show.  This place was packed!  Even so early on a Saturday!  \n\nWe ordered a carafe of sangria for the table (lovely) and a St. Germain's cocktail carafe (also lovely, but good in smaller portions, so thank goodness there were six of us).  We also shared a goat cheese appetizer.  Not enough garlic bread comes with the order to sop up all the extra tomato sauce, but luckily their baguettes for the table are just as delicious and will be replenished if you ask.  The most impressive thing was the one of us was on a gluten-free diet, so not only did she get a special gluten-free menu, but they brought her gluten free bread!  Not bad.  The rest of us enjoyed our gluten-packed alternatives and the pickled carrots that came with it were something I'd never think to serve with bread and butter, but strangely worked.  \n\nFor the entrees 2 of us got steak, 2 got fish, one got veggies, and one got chicken.  The portions are very plentiful, the sauces well-balanced, and the food was all fresh and warm.  I opted for the filet au poivre.  We were informed the filets were so tender we could cut them with a butter knife...which may explain why we didn't get steak knives.  While I do love fork-tender meat, i also sometimes appreciate a steak knife, even if I \"don't need it\".  I hit a little gristle at one point that was very hard to work through with just my regular table knife, but at that point it wasn't worth it to ask for the steak knife.  Other than that, the steak tasted wonderful, and it was cooked perfectly rare for my tastes.  My second gripe, though, was with the \"fries\" that came with it.  I love that they're innovative and these aren't just typical steak fries, but unfortunately they didn't float my boat.  They were very much a cross between fries and chips.  I'm not a fan of potato chips unless they're flavored or I have dip for them.  But when I'm eating a nice filet, I especially am not in the mood for potato chips.  Le sigh.  They weren't committed enough to either the fry or the chip lineage, so I was left disappointed.  Now I imagine for the rest of the dining public, they'd probably love a chip/fry hybrid.  Sadly, even a side of mayo to dip my fries in (it's so good!  and very belgian) didn't help much.  \n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert, sadly, but in all the dining experience was lovely, and the food really was delicious (minus my personal vendetta against the \"fries\").  I would gladly go back, because you get a nice meal for a much more reasonable price than at many of the other fancy Vegas gourmet restaurants with an unbeatable view."

We looked at the menu, saw that breakfast looked good, and decided to come back.\n\nBefore we went back though, we did some quick research and found that first, this place was ranked 24th our of over 2000 Vegas restaurants on tripadvisor and found that every list of the best brunch places and best patio restaurants had this one at the top.  It was a no brainer at that point.\n\nUnfortunately, they do not take reservations for the patio, so we had to wait about 40 minutes on Saturday morning. I don't recall the time - 9 or 10AM.  Anyway, this place is unbelievably good.  When we next find ourselves in Vegas, I am sure we'll do something different for everything - different dinners, nightclubs, different hotel (and we liked every place we stayed and went) - but we will absolutely be back here.\n\nI got simple eggs benedict, she got eggs florentine, and we both got large Cafe au Lait (it comes in a bowl!).  I just can't express how good the food and coffee was.  There's really nothing else that needs to be said.  Food = superb.  Ambiance (patio dining on the Strip in early Spring) = superb.  Service = superb.  And it wasn't too pricey.  Go here.  Wait for the patio.  You won't regret it."

The cheeses were served with a sprinkle of honey on top in addition to some nuts and raisin nut bread. The cheese just melts in your mouth and the combination of the nuts and honey make it awesome. The trout was cooked just right with a some toasted almonds on top,and the chocolate tart was the perfect way to end the meal. The second time I went was this past weekend. I knew that it was famous for its steak, so I decided to order one. I ordered the steak bordelaise which is steak topped with a carmelized onion red wine sauce. This dish was to die for. The steak was juicy and tender, and it had great flavoring. It came with a side of hand-cut frites which were also really good. The service was great both times. Definitely coming back my next trip to vegas."

To drink, I had a house merlot and a cup of coffee.\n\nI think they brought me the wrong pate, as there are two--a country pate and a chicken liver mousse pate. The former comes with pickles, and the latter is a liver-and-wine pate. What I ate was good, so no complaints, but be aware that there are two pate appetizers, so mix-ups are possible. \n\nThe steak was good--I'd asked for rare, but in hindsight, they really couldn't cook a steak that thin rare, so that was more on me than them that it was closer to medium. I don't fault them for that. The fries were an interesting almost hybrid of a fry and a chip (or if you're English, a chip and a crisp!). The mousse came with little chocolate crispy things on top and was quite nice. I'm not a wine drinker, so I won't even attempt to judge the wine. The coffee was fine."

  "text" : "Out of all the places on the strip to eat, this has to be one of the chillest. I went here solo in late April, and loved it. \n\nAfter my 40 minute standing wait for a seat at the outside bar, I was pleasantly seated with my glass of wine i'd been sipping on enjoying the view. What's that view? Well the strip of course, and you're smack dab in front of the Bellagio. It's worth the wait just to sit on my ass, drink, and people watch from a dimly lit, ear numbing hum of a packed restaurant. Though don't think it's not tolerable, because even at 10 o'clock at night its packed, and when that fountain goes off across the street. It's perfect. At the time Frank sinatra was blasting across the street, beautiful pressure filled cannons were shooting droplets of water high into the sky. Hell I must of had a good buzz by then, when my preoccupation became fixed on staring into the night sky, with all the chaos around me.  \n\nAfter losing a lot of money on slots I was cautious in my order decisions. I had a couple glass' of the house red, which was maybe 9 bucks and change. A decision of duck was made, with classically french bread in order. That bread? Yeah that breads free with your meal, so stuff your face with it. Don't forget the butter, lots of it. Your baguettes no good if you're not slathering the damned thing in copious amounts of butter.\n\nCompliments of the chef that night; a light and airy shredded carrot, cabbage, and ginger root medley. Presented nicely like a scoop of ice-cream. Presentation: simple, execution on texture and most importantly flavor: devine. Hints of red wine vinegar pulled the strings together. If only they were ice-cream, they were begging to be.\n\nRoasted duck came with a small but adequate micro salad, hence the micro part you say. But I do want some roughage when I'm cannibalizing on a fresh, juicy piece of french duck in America's city of excess. If they can fly in fresh seafood overnight across the street, where's my fresh plucked greens from the countryside of southern France? The ducks the best I've ever had, period. And marinated bing cherries bring the superb amount of sour needed to such a rich slab of meat. \n\nAll in all it's good. So sit down, drink some wine, and enjoy some classically french dishes. Escape the heads below you that are sipping on their expired Jimmy Buffett margarita's, the live nude girls guaranteed to you in 20 minutes or less, and the all alluring card table. But please, sit outside, you may want to not be seen or be heard. But theres so much to see, so much to hear, and even more to feel."

Then finally, i had the chance to try Mon Ami Gabi for the first time last month. \nI made reservations on Sunday for a party of 6 at 6pm and when we arrived we got seated right away. My friends and I ordered many of the popular items and tried each other's meals. Things i've tried: \n- Smoked Salmon: This was pretty tasty. Went very well with the bread they gave you. \n- Escargots: I didn't try this, but my friends said it was okay.\n- Filet Mignon: Cooked with a batter that surrounded the steak. I didn't quite enjoy it and thought it wasn't so flavorful\n- Steak Bordelaise: This one was actually really flavorful and better than the filet mignon to me (surprisingly because it was half the price of the filet mignon)\n- Chicken Grandmere: Mediocre, nothing special about this chicken. \n- Caramelized sea Scallops: Very salty and not that tasty to me \n- Pork Pillard: thick cut, kind of chewy. Not that great to me \n- Mac & Cheese: It was cheesy but not the best mac and cheese i've tasted. Kind of bland\n- Aparagus: Mediocre, nothing special \n \nOverall, i was a bit disappointed with this restaurant. I thought the food was going to be top notch, but everything tasted mediocre and didn't blow my mind. I enjoyed the fresh bread and pickled carrots they gave in the beginning. Service was a bit slow due to the high crowds. Ambiance is a bit loud and voices echo because we sat in the patio area. Pretty restaurant. Great views of the Eiffel towel along with the surroundings. I would not come back if i was in vegas and it was truly a one time thing."

My wife made a reservation for 5:15, but then because of a show we wanted to see, she decided to play it safe and reschedule the reservation for 5:00.  This was no problem at all.\n\nWhen we arrived at about 4:45, it seemed a little empty but that's because most people were outside on the patio overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  We also requested to be seated outside, and we got a table easily (Probably because it was so early).  I would recommend going closer to sunset, as we were partially exposed to the sun for the entire meal.  However, patio seating is first come, first serve so it may be a lot tougher to secure a table later in the evening... (The inside looked very romantic as well)\n\nI tried the Frangria, which was good enough to last me the entire meal.  We started with the warm Brie and the French Onion Soup, both of which were pretty amazing.  My wife ordered the classic steak with the butter sauce, and I tried the one with the bleu cheese.  She went medium, and because I was curious about the difference, I went with medium-rare.  Both steaks were cooked as ordered, and the difference between the two was obvious.  Many restaurants, unfortunately, screw this up...  But not Mon Ami Gabi!\n\nEven though we were pretty full after the meal, I received an ice-cream puff type thing as a birthday dessert.  That wasn't bad either.\n\nService was excellent!  It seemed the guy filling up water and taking away dishes was sitting behind us just waiting until the glasses or plates were empty!  Our waiter was very attentive, and while we didn't try to test out his knowledge of the food or beverages, we had zero complaints about him.  \n\nSo, for the drink, brie, soup, and two steaks, we paid about $85 before the tip.  \n\nFor the quality of the food, and the overall atmosphere compared to other restaurants, the price was right!  (Gordon Ramsay steak is an average of $100 per plate.)\n\nWhile, I'll probably be more interested in trying a different steakhouse next time around (only because I like new things), we definitely want to come back and try out Mon Ami's brunch someday."

  "text" : "I have vacationed regularly in Vegas for over 15 years and I've eaten at many places on the strip.  Everytime I visit I must eat at Mon Ami.  I absolutely love it and it is, hands down, my favorite restaurant there.\n\nThere are lots of great foodie experiences up and down the strip, and it's important to do your research before blowing up your wallet on something that turns out to be underwhelming, which can easily happen.  That's why I always go back to Mon Ami.  It is consistently good, from the food to the service, and their prices are reasonable, particularly when it comes to steak.  At some of the celebrity chef owned steakhouses on the strip, you could easily spend $40-$60 just on the meat without blinking an eye, and what you spend doesn't always match the quality.  The steaks aren't bad, per se, they just aren't, in my opinion, always worth it.\n\nMon Ami's steaks are terrific - whether you get the steak bordelaise or the filet mignon.  Excellent quality cow, and always cooked perfectly.  They have other offerings, but I always go for the steaks.  Their apps are great, too - I usually go for the escargot, but their oysters are also excellent.  The atmosphere is very cozy, very parisian bistro (as one would expect at Paris), with a fabulous outdoor patio that sits directly across from the Bellagio, so you get a terrific view of the fountains, as well as prime people watching, from this vantage point.  Excellent cocktails and very nice wine selection.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a place to have a private dinner party, Mon Ami is the place.  I wound up having my 30th birthday dinner party there after looking at other options.  A lot of the trendy hot spots required you to have a set/limited menu starting at ridiculous prices.  At Mon Ami, there was an expected minimum to spend for the bill, but my guests could order whatever they wanted, which was important to me.  The private room was absolutely perfect - held about 20 people comfortably and had large glass windows with a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains - what a magical setting!  \n\nMon Ami is also a place that shouldn't be overlooked for breakfast/brunch.  Wonderful selection of sweet and savory, from crepes to omlets - and, if you go for an early breakfast or late lunch, you have a much better chance of getting a patio table.  Even if you have reservations, it's always first come first served for the patio, and the wait can be very long at peek hours.\n\nFor wheelchair users, the aisles in the restaurant are wide and spacious with lots of room to navigate.  The tables are aptly spaced, which makes seating comfortable.  The patio can be tight when it's crowded, but definitely take advantage of it during off times.  It's worth the view."

I was thinking German pancakes at Ihop but they were more crepe-like.  I think they would have been better a bit more dense, spongy, as opposed to flaky and almost crispy and dry on the ends.

  "text" : "It has been a long time since I last visited Mon Ami Gabi (probably 2 years), but it popped up on my \"have you been to...\" suggestions, so I'll review it! The absolute best thing about the restaurant is its location. The Paris got really lucky when the Bellagio opened and built beautiful fountains out front - now many of their restaurants (like Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant) have a phenomenal view. Be sure to request a table on the patio where you can see the fountain show...it's definitely worth waiting for, and you can drink at the bar while you wait!\n\nI give this restaurant three stars because I remember feeling underwhelmed by the food. Everything was tasty, but for a restaurant in a prime location at the strip, you usually expect something special. I had a New York strip, their fries, and we shared a bunch of appetizers that I honestly can't remember anymore. It was a fun experience and perfectly fine food...I would go back happily (but probably wouldn't be the one suggesting it)."

The hostesses were all very kind and accommodating even with 2 of our people running a little late. We luckily ended up getting a table outside with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nOur server was absolutely fantastic and helpful, and most of the staff had that great level of professionalism you expect from a high end restaurant. Everyone at the table ordered different appetizers and they were phenomenal. I had the smoked salmon which was really incredible, I highly recommend it. \n\nThe baked goat cheese appetizer was ginormous, as was the onion soup au gratin. \n\nEveryone loved their food. Seriously, their was a hush over the table as everyone savored their meals. I will say, I got the chicken paillard and was somewhat dissapointed in how dry the chicken was, so, I would not recommend that. The sauce and veggies it came with were good though. The trout amandine was delicious as well.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience, the food and ambiance are lovely, this place is excellent for a date night or an intimate outing with friends. GO! I can't wait to try their breakfast/brunch menu."

It was basically a block of cheese with onions and bread. I came away with the feeling I could have made that in the kitchen, and that isn't a good sign.\n\nThe salad with kale is definitely false advertising. Reminded me of the \"may contain peanuts\" warnings as the salad may contain kale. Dressing was also hugely disappointing too. \n\nI forget what else I ordered as it was completely forgettable other than the taste of disappointment.\n\nThis was also the only restaurant in Vegas I was disappointed with the service. It was busy so I totally understand the wait to take our order, but when the food was delivered they basically dumped it on the table. Didn't take any stars off for that as in the end I judge based on the food, but it did stick out as something out of place."

My Dad was always a huge fan of this place so we would go all the time and now we live here in Vegas so we try to make it as often as possible. Service is always top notch just like the food. Remember to call ahead and ask what the specials are that night, Thursday-Saturday I believe. The inside seating is quite dark so bring a flashlight but the patio section is right on The Strip so it's awesome views of the hotels and the people! Plus if you go in the evening you get the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes which gives you an amazing show. Be sure to try the Sangria in the Summer because it's out of this world.

That is saying a lot. We've dined at nice and quite expensive restaurants all over the country. None of them matched  Mon Ami Gabi for the totality of the experience.\n\nMy wife and I both had steaks that were quite flavorful and done exactly as we requested. I had onion soup which was rich and flavorful, and all the sides especially the pommes frites were wonderful. Ymmm...\n\nMy wife loved the Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine. Don't let the price scare you off it is wonderful and worth every cent. My wife worked in high end private clubs a number of years ago and remembered it from then. It was so good she went for a second glass.\n\nThe service was also marvelous. High marks to Matthew Dunaway our server.  He had the perfect combination of menu knowledge, timing, was appropriately engaging and completely professional. He made it a very enjoyable evening for us. Great guy, ask for him !\n\nThe al fresco dining is the best way to enjoy an evening there in my opinion. You get a great view of the surrounding area, the Bellagio fountains, the Eiffel tower and the colorful crowd walking below.\n\nWe'll make sure we go there on every future trip!\n\n I suggest you do as well. This business really cares about their customers and that is refreshing to find."

We both recalled how much we loved their French Onion Soup.\n\nWith some relatives coming down the street, I was disappointed by the young lady managing the hostess desk.  She wouldn't even say if or how long our wait was, \"Unless your full party is here.\"  I could understand not being seated, but the rude tone and nonsensical retort that they can't even give you an estimate on wait time got things off to a poor start.  Then, we were seated immediately when our family members arrived.\n\nThe menu is simple enough and the food was good, but not great.  Salads were unremarkable.  The Fillet Mignon was very good.  And the final bill was about $205 for four adults, a toddler, and a baby.  Note: They put 18% gratuity on for themselves.\n\nThere were much better years ago.

The portions, while enough to fully satisfy me, will probably bother those who want a cheap and large meal and are content with that meal being merely \"good\".

  "text" : "I think I've found my new favorite breakfast/brunch place in Vegas! \n\nAMBIENCE:\nI swear I've been to Vegas hundreds of times and have probably walked by Mon Ami just as many times, but have never set foot in the restaurant because I always assumed it was too expensive.  Mon Ami is located right at the strip and at the bottom of the Paris hotel.  There is patio seating, so if you are lucky, you get to people watch (my faveeee!!) as you eat :)\n\n**TIP: If you do decide on patio seating, make sure you get there early so you don't have to wait too long.  \n\nI'm not one to be known for my patience, so both times I've been here, I've opted for the regular dining inside the restaurant.  The restaurant feels a little bit upscale because there are dark woods, tablecloths, wine glasses, but don't let that fool you b/c dishes range about $15-$18, which is not bad considering the quality of food you get.\n\nFOOD QUALITY:\nOkay, most importantly, you want to know about the food right? Let me tell you - it is AMAZING.  If I was trapped in a deserted island and could only bring 3 things with me, I may say their Skinny Pancakes as one of my 3 things.  It was offered as a special when I went the last time I dined here and I am so glad I ordered it!  The pancake was as thin as a crepe and drizzled with this nice glaze, topped with glazed pears.  What I loved was that the edges of the pancake, which were not yet touched by the glaze was still crispy, so it was a wonderful mixture of texture and flavors with every bite!\n\nI also LOVE that the bread comes out warrrrmmm!!! Mmm mmm!  My thighs now hate me because of my love/hate relationship with warm bread and butter, but it is SO GOOD (sorry thighs).\n\nI also got the Strawberry Waffle as well here and it was equally as delicious!  The strawberries were sweet and juicy and the pancakes were cooked to crispy delectable perfection.  Don't even get me started with that maple syrup.  I was trying to find other things I could dip into that maple syrup just so I could have more.\n\n**TIP:  They also have a Blood Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant. I believe it was about $11-$12.  It loved amaze-balls!  I will definitely be back to try it out the next time.\n\nSERVICE:\nService was great!  The main thing I need in the morning is COFFEE!  Don't even try getting a coherent answer from me until I've had at least 2-3 cups.  Our waitress kept my coffee refilled at all times.  Poor thing, I don't think she's ever seen anyone drink that much coffee in her life lol.\n\nOVERALL:\nThe breakfast here is just what I need to wake me up from Vegas nights.  I love the atmosphere and the quality of food is what will keep me coming back!  Give it a try the next time you're in Vegas!"

Service was fast and friendly here as well.\n\nThey are CRAZY busy here though...make a reservation, most likely an hour or two ahead during lunch hours at least!  But it will be worth the wait :P"

  "text" : "My fiancé and I planned a small wedding in Vegas and needed a good, yet affordable, restaurant for our reception dinner.  Since we were staying at the Paris and I had eaten there before and knew it was good, we decided on Mon Ami Gabi.  \n\nI got in touch with the event coordinator, Drew, who sent me information via email including prices for a private party room with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Although that sounded lovely, we were not having too many guests and opted for a table in the main dining room.  Therefore, no deposit was needed.  All we had to do was make the reservation and confirm the number of guests 24 hours prior to the dinner.  I also asked if we could drop off favors beforehand to have set up at each place setting, which they were happy to accommodate.\n\nThe dinner went very smoothly and was a big success.  We arrived on time and our table for 17 was ready with the favors.  Drink and appetizer orders were taken and delivered quickly and everything was delicious!  They also brought out bread and rolls.  Just about everyone ordered some kind of steak and once again, everything was brought our swiftly.  Our meals were perfect!  Everyone was raving!  Dessert was also amazing; bread pudding, crème brulee, some kind of chocolate yumminess, etc.\n\nSomething needs to be said about the atmosphere, too; lots of dark wood, wine bottles lining the wall and large windows facing the fountains.  The lighting was dim and elegant.  It's the type of place at which I would expect to pay a lot more.\n\nAnd speaking of...the bill, including gratuity, came out to less than half of what we had budgeted for!  Great deal!\n\nOverall, we were very pleased with the planning, service, and quality of the food.  I look forward to dining there again when I'm back in Vegas!"

We ate outside and even though it was 90 degrees, the AC was cranked up inside and leaked out to the outside tables.  I do not like to be hot, so it was perfect! \nHad the onion soup, it was only OK, sweet without any beef or onion flavor.  Ordered the filet, medium rare.  First one came out well done. The second one raw in the middle. The third one cam out medium instead of medium rare, but I ate it anyway.  It was good, but would have been great if it had been properly cooked. My husband got the NY strip and it came out perfect. It is huge at 16 oz. The waiter tried his best, but the kitchen let us down.  \nFour stars for hubby's meal and mine steak once it was done properly, other wise 5 stars for location and the rest of the food."

Shawn was nice enough to pack us a pound for $20.   Even our friends were complimenting the coffee back home.  \n\nWe ordered our favorite french onion soup and my FIL had the oyster soup.  Both were very delicious.   My husband got the lobster roll which I would order next time for lunch.  My MIL had the french toast which I thought was on the sweeter side.   I wouldn't mind sharing the french toast but not as my main meal.

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi, je t'aime!\n\nI was in Las Vegas for my birthday this year and was perusing Yelp to find the perfect restaurant near MGM that would not break mine or my friends' bank account but also that would have good food, service etc. Mon Ami met my criteria and thankfully Yelp allowed me to make reservations via the Yelp app on my iphone. \n\nI am so glad I made reservations, there was a lot of people waiting outside for dinner when we got there. We were given a table within 10 minutes of arriving in the inner dining hall which had a spectacular view of the Bellagio and it's water fountain show! Hooray for free grandiose entertainment on my birthday! \n\nOur waitress knew were crunched for time as we had a show to catch, so she made sure to bring out everything promptly. While we waited for our food we were given warm loaves of bread, butter, and this amazing carrot salad that you eat with the bread and butter. I'm not going to lie, we asked for more--I just won't tell you how many times we asked for more.\n\nOur food was delicious. My party ordered scallops, steak, salmon, crab so I made sure to sample every single dish and they were all amazingly good. Simply a delight. The salmon melted in my mouth and was accompanied by a quinoa salad. The scallop plate had just the right amount of bacon and was served with greens. The steak came with fries! Two of my friends shared the sea food platter and devoured it. At the end of the meal Mon Ami brought out ice cream for my birthday and sang to me!\n\nWe left the restaurant feeling full and happy. I thought it was a great birthday dinner and I so glad my friends agreed."

We shared the Brie starter and I had the seared scallops while my bf had the Beef Wellington. The food is quite good. And the wine list is very much reasonably priced so we ordered a bottle.

I made a huge mistake of ordering my steak rare. Because the steak is so thin, I pretty much got a medium-done steak. The steak was pretty tasty, but I really do prefer my steaks/burgers RARE, so I was very disappointed. \nThe second time, I was there for breakfast/brunch. I got the egg white omelet. The consistency of the omelet is very interesting... it's INCREDIBLY fluffy, which was a bit weird to me at first, but still pretty tasty. It can be a bit bland though, so I added a bit of salt and it was perfect. \nI hear the french toast is amazing, and will be getting that next time!"

The AC inside was working well, and our table felt like a cool breeze was blowing. Very nice view of the Bellagio fountains. Basically a perfect setting for a patio on the strip. \n\nNow for the food. We ordered the onion soup. A big bowl. Very sweet. Maybe we should have added a little salt. I liked it. Wife was \"meh\". \n\nWe both got steaks. Wife got filet. I got the NY Strip. We ordered medium rare, and both came medium (or a little more--no pink). I was OK with that, but my wife sent it back. Waiter came back with a totally rare steak! I mean pretty much raw from about 1/4 in to the middle. We asked for a medium rare steak, so sent it back again. Waiter came back with a medium steak. Ug. I was halfway done, so my wife decided to eat it. It was good, but not what she ordered. We chose to stop complaining since we didn't think it would do any good.\n\nAt any rate, I recommend the place, but check your steak when you get it. If it comes wrong, send them ALL back since you want all your food to come out at the same time. Ask for the manager too, maybe at least they can comp you the food. We should have done that."

  "text" : "Brenda's daughter took us to Mon Ami Gabi for a Sunday breakfast to show off the place she works and to have us try their food since she knows we enjoy a good meal. Although the place looks like it might be expensive considering it's right on The Strip, the prices were reasonable. Since we only had breakfast, it's the only meal this review is based on. If you're going for lunch or dinner, check out other reviews elsewhere.\n\nAlthough we had reservations for 10:00, we wanted to sit on the patio which is first-come, first-served. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table to open, but that's probably because the daughter worked here. Had she not, we probably would have been waiting a bit longer. If the weather is nice, we'd recommend patio seating. Some people complain about the smell of the exhaust, but we never noticed it. It's a great place to people-watch and has a great view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nWe started with coffee while we were checking out the menu. It was nice and strong without the bitter taste you can get when restaurants just add too much coffee grind to the water. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also very good, but I would have preferred it a bit colder. I had their special of the day which was similar to Eggs Florentine but without the artichoke. The egg was poached to perfection--little dispersion of the egg white and when cut into, the yolk just flowed over the English muffin. The breakfast potatoes were good, but nothing you can't find at most other places. The nice thing about eating at more upscale restaurants is that the food is usually properly seasoned before it comes to your table so there is no need to add additional salt or pepper to get the flavor correct. Brenda had the mixed berry pancakes. Any time she sees something on the menu with \"berry\" in it, she'll probably order it. The pancakes were closer to crepes than what Americans think of as pancakes, but they were still good. The daughter had an egg-white omelet along with the fresh fruit bouquet that we all shared. The portion size might be considered small if compared to IHOP or another restaurant chain that specializes in breakfasts, but we didn't go away hungry. Our only mistake was that we should have ordered some croissants and baguettes to go with breakfast. That's one thing we miss from the time we lived in Europe--the ability to hit the local bakery for some great, fresh breads every morning. The next trip we'll have to try the quiche or the French toast. Both looked good as they passed our table on the way to someone else.\n\nAll through the meal the service was outstanding, but when you sit on the patio there's just on aisle between two rows of tables so it's not hard to catch a waiter. We'd definitely stop back here again for breakfast; however, a quick scan of their dinner menu really didn't excite us. It looked like there were a lot of good things on the menu, but there are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas where you can get the same things."

From the host to the server to the bus staff, everyone was very polite and professional.

My husband and I had our two sons and three of their friends with us, all ranging from 19-22 years old, so my husband ordered escargot without telling them what it was. When it arrived they loved it and even had another piece after we told them what it was. The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten. I had the trout and it was outstanding.

  "text" : "Virtually everyone recommended this place, and I can see why.  It's not a very \"Las Vegas\" type of place, considering that the portions are not huge (at least for the vegetarian options we enjoyed), and the focus was completely on the quality of ingredients rather than the spectacle of the presentation.  The food was actually kind of simple, but every single morsel was exquisite, as if the chefs had actually gone to the farmer's market that afternoon to pluck the choicest specimens from each basket of fruits and vegetables, hand-selected the cheeses, or churned the butter themselves that morning.  You know that great food you get in the Bay Area when the chef is plugged into the best local growers?  That was what this was like.  Somehow, inexplicably in the Nevada desert, the chefs at Mon Ami Gabi figured out how to make it seem like the French countryside was just down the street.  Yes, it was expensive, but no more so than any other great French restaurant I've enjoyed, and ultimately it became one of the highlights of our trip.\n\nThat night, the kitchen was an utter disaster with a huge leak that completely flooded the entire bar and surrounding tables (where we were sitting), and it could have been absolute chaos.  People slipped on the wet floor, staff had to let patrons slosh over soaked tablecloths strewn over the slick surfaces for extra traction, and the flooding was obviously worse in the kitchen where the leak had erupted.  All of this could have made for a regrettable experience, but instead the staff rose to the challenge and kept the place afloat (pardon the pun) with excellent service, great attitudes, and appropriate kindness in the midst of what was probably (and hopefully) one of the worst work nights they've had to endure.  Such grace under pressure was inspiring. I haven't seen that level of service anywhere except at the best San Francisco restaurants, so to find that right on the Vegas Strip under such extreme circumstances, combined with the lusciously fresh and perfectly prepared food, made for an experience dripping (ahem) in quality.\n\nI guess that means Mon Ami Gabi isn't the place to visit if you want to encapsulate the Vegas experience, but is definitely the place for those who want something that transcends the strip. Mathis would be a great restaurant in any city - and that's saying something."

That day it was pork roast with potatoes. let me tell you, it was delicious, and although some have mentioned the portions are \"smaller\" than regular restaurants, it filled me up. If you want great job, get a reservation and enjoy hardly any wait. If you want the outside seating for the ambiance, expect at least an hour wait."

Worth a visit if you are looking for a nice eatery without breaking the bank and getting your money's worth. \n\nEscargots - Sauce tasted great, reminded me of muscles. \n\nFrisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad with soft-poached egg - AWESOME. Not sure why I haven't seen poached egg used a salad dressing until now, but wow. \n\nSteak and Fries - Steak is flattened like a flank and tastes great. Get it medium to medium rare since the steak is so thin. Tasted even better 3 hours later, cold. Fries are super crispy and tasty. \n\nLamb Burger - It was a special and it was great as well. Funny thing is though, the burger tasted even better the next day for some left overs. \n\nGo Go Go!!! It is worth your time if you are looking to drop some money (not too much) and want some refinement. \n\nOh yea, service was awesome. Some of the best we've seen anywhere."

The mussels are to die for, mainly the garlic and cream based sauce. I also recommend any of the cocktails, the steaks, the frites, the after dinner coffees, desserts, all of it. You can get all of the above-mentioned items for around a hundred dollars, with two drinks per person!

My French Onion soup was bland -- like beef broth poured on bread with melted cheese. My seafood crepe was way too salty. On top of the crepe were 3 shrimp and 2 scallops -- all were over grilled, making them tough and tasteless. The Bloody Mary was just not good.

We didn't feel like they were hoovering over us making sure our coffee cups were full.  We got an outside table.  It was a clear, blue sky morning and warm.  Not many people walking the strip (probably sleeping in from the night before).  A couple runners here and there.  \n\nOrdered:\n- coffees\n- croissant sandwich\n- big skinny pancakes (I think it was a special of the day)\n- homemade brioche\n\nCoffee was great.  Smoother than Starbucks Blonde (as a comparison).  Croissant sandwich was good.  Nothing really special about it.  Skinny pancakes were great.  Never had them before.  With the whip cream and fruit, it was a light n sweet treat to compliment my black coffee.  Never had brioche, so I didn't know what to expect.  But at first sight, it looked like a french toast without the syrup or egg brush.  Just a thick toast basically with a side of butter.  In comparison, to everything we ordered, the brioche was the most bland (maybe that's what it's suppose to be).  Overall, I think the price of the food could be a bit cheaper.  Maybe knock of $2/item on the breakfast menu while keeping the same quality/portions would be fair.  If that were the case, I would compensate by tipping the waiter more.  \n\nDetailed Ratings:\nService: 5\nAmbiance/View: 5\nFood: 4"

Silly me - I didn't know about the outside patio, since we came in from the other side. Oh well, next time. So we ended up sitting inside, which was actually better for me, since it was still 92 \ndegrees outside. \n\nThings do happen fast here and I did appreciate it. Water was served to us within a minute of seating, loaf of bread within 3 minutes. It's cute how they bring out the bread - warm and wrapped in a paper sleeve like it just came from the bakery. Dinner came out in what seemed like less than 10 minutes - wow! I ordered the Chicken Grandmere - the chicken was cooked perfectly and was delicious mixed with the mashed potatoes, bacon and mushrooms. I just had to savor every bite! Veruka had the Carmelized Sea Scallops. The scallops literally melted in your mouth! She must have liked it because there wasn't a scrap of food left on her plate after a few minutes! We were just about to skip dessert, when I noticed that bread pudding was on the menu, (specifically, White Chocolate Bread Pudding). That is one of my weaknesses, so I had to try it and I wasn't disappointed! Perhaps I should have eaten it a little slower, so I could prolong the experience, but Veruka was complaining that she was tired and wanted to go home. It was a good dinner, and a good way to end the night. Wait staff was pretty attentive and friendly, although I have to admit, I couldn't understand a lot of the stuff that they were saying. Yeah, we'll come here again!\n\nJust a note to myself: my new favorite beer is Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout."

I had a savory crepe for my breakfast and it was just divine. I believe it is a buckwheat crepe, which I love even more.\n\nDuring a dinner visit on our first evening, I had their filet with merlot sauce. Probably a top 5 favorite dish of mine in the USA. The sauce is just amazing. Decadent, a little buttery, soak it up with bread worthy.  Just as good on our last night as it was on our first night and after the bad experience at Prime, fully convinced me that flash and high $-rated restaurants are not important at all.\n\nThe bread, of course, is always beautifully warm. \n\nTheir bananas foster crepe is also delicious (I got a few bites in even though some guests at the table were duking it out for prime spoon positioning).\n\nGreat service, great atmosphere, my favorite place in Vegas."

We enjoyed a Bordeux Superior during the meal and a Cafe Latte at the completion.  Dion was very attentive throughout and this was possibly the best meal we enjoyed in Vegas that week.  The decor is a styling of turn of the 19th century old Paris, and we were comfortable for the entire time we languished at our table.

The ambiance was amazing and intimate, but needless to say we were probably the loudest group of teenagers in that restaurant! (no one scolded us for that though). While were were waiting to order dinner, we got loafs of warms & soft bread with butter, and some radish pickle-like dish (with vinegar) that had a great taste!\n\nI'd have to say, it is really reasonably priced for this restaurant being located in Vegas and being a fancy French place at that. For dinner, I got the salmon on a bed of quinoa with lemon sauce. It was a delicious piece of salmon and the lemon quinoa went perfectly with it!\n\nFor dessert, we got some French dessert (any ideas what it is called?) - which was delicious! Overall, great service, food & ambiance! I'd definitely make it back here in the future!"

It was nice that we made a reservation ahead of time so we could skip the wait line, but the wait didn't seem that bad either on a Sunday brunch time.  We got the quiche, a blueberry muffin, and a lobster roll.  The blueberry muffin was okay, would have been better if it was hot.  BUT, the quiche and lobster roll were bombdiggidty.  Large portions too.  Wish I took a picture of the lobster roll, but it came in a \"brick toast\" with a little pocket at the top with lobster filling stuffed inside.  It was certainly unique and definitely delicious.  Lots of people were ordering the standard ham and cheese sandwhich that you would normally order at a french brunch place, and they looked to be enjoying themselves as well.\n\nCan't wait to return!"

I like this restaurant but it always seems cramped and crowded, tough to have a conversation. We arrived and were seated promptly due to having a reservation. Service was on top of getting us drink orders and appetizer round. As an Appetizer we had the warm Brie Cheese. A delightful appetizer that prepares your meal without feeling heavy. The Wife had that Almond trout. She always has this and it never disappoints. I had Gabi's Fish & Frites. Basically fish and chips. This was not what I expexted and was greatly surprised. It is a pan fried trout with Panko crust. I really enjoy their tarter sauce i had to order extra. Overall a great meal despite the cramped feeling during the meal."

The French onion soup was very tasty, a bit sweeter than most, which was fine and lots of cheese, which is great.  The escargot was good, with enough butter anything tastes good.  The skate was a very good entree choice but the filet mignon was over cooked, such as a shame.  The desserts were excellent as you would expect, the creme brulee and the profiteroles.  Overall I would have given them a 5 as the ambiance, location, appetizers, and desserts were all a 5 but the entrees, filet in particular, were a 3."

The restaurant itself is decorated beautifully, and the outdoor dining overlooks the Bellagio fountains, which is an added bonus.\n\nI started with the escargots, which were very mediocre. Escargots are quite literally my favorite food, so I'm quite the connoisseur when it comes to them. They tasted fine, but they didn't have much flavor. They were definitely forgettable. 5.5/10.\n\nFor my entre, I had the Filet Mignon Merlot. It was very flavorful and the red wine reduction was delicious. The frites were tasty, and very different.

Waited was less than 15mins on a Monday around 7pm. This place gets super jammed packed but i guess we just happen to beat the crowd and got seated very fast.  Very friendly staff and noticed each server had its own assigned duty, from being a waiter, to a busier to bread & water guy.  Service is very fast yet still able to maintain that upscale class.  I swear i saw around 30 servers just in the outside patio area. \n\nNow comes down to the food:\n\nComplementary fresh bagget with homemade slivers of beets.  Bread and butter is great and the Beets are awesome which complements the bread very well. I hate beets in the first place but they tasted like apples. \n\nI tried the Steak Au Poivre with the Brandy Peppercorn sauce which is awesome and very tasty. Also tried the Hanger steak with the Merlot Butter which was to die for.  Hands down on the sauce as it complements the steak very well.  Classic Bearnaise Sauce pretty good too but I'd prefer the Merlot butter sauce instead. In my opinion,  Mash potatoes were delicious and I would substitute it instead of the Frites because they go a little over board on it.  Reminds of a over cooked shredded hash brown. \n\nThere is no dress code, but people that are dressed up are usually placed inside while the casual wear customers were placed outside. \n\nI'd definitely my make rounds back her for a nice dinner out in the patio watching the Bellagio water show."

  "text" : "My friend and I wanted to enjoy a very nice dinner without having to spend a ridiculous amount of money. Mon Ami Gabi was the perfect place. The atmosphere inside was that of a classy steakhouse. As an appetizer, we ordered the chicken liver mousse, which was very tasty. Definitely more mousse than a party of two could handle, though. My friend ordered the steak classique, which came with an herb butter, and pom fritte. She loved the steak, but wasn't excited over the pom fritte. She said it tasted like she was eating fancy potato chips. I ordered the chicken grandmere, and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! I usually don't eat the skin, but you could see how perfectly this half chicken was cooked that it was a must to experience the full flavor of the dish. The chicken came with creamy mashed potatoes and a sauteed mix of pearled onions, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and bacon (the real deal chunky bits of bacon)! While eating the chicken I was surprised to find roasted garlic, mushroom and rosemary tucked beneath the skin of the chicken to add even more flavor to the already tasty meat. Overall, our meal was wonderful! The chicken entree was $20.95, and the steak classique was $24.95. For those who like chicken liver pate, $10.95 for a large portion is what you'll pay. This was a wonderful, affordable steakhouse restaurant, and I will more than likely return on my next visit to Vegas."

Both were very tasty.  \n\nService:  Chris did a great job as our server.\n\nHints/Final thoughts:  Mon Ami Gabi is a really nice dining spot.

  "text" : "7/4/13  Dinner\n\nMy third time dining at Mon Ami Gabi doesn't disappoint. For a French steak restaurant on the Strip, this place offers great food at a great value. My party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. Surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking Bellagio fountain across the street. Patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108F day we just didn't feel like eating outside. Plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.\n\nServer was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. Despite being very busy for 4th of July, service was not pushy at all. We spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed Mid-West beef.\n\n*Paris Romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello. \n*Grey Goose Cosmopolitan ($14): just the way I like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink\n\nOur table goes for beef since this is a classic French bistro specializes in meat.\n\n*Chicken Liver Mousse Pate ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. It really set the mood of dinner for the evening.\n\n*Filet Mignon Merlot ($34.95): very tender, almost like Wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. I've had Harris's filet mignon and loved it. But Mon Ami Gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is \"even.\" This is one of the best filet mignon I have had. The handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. They give you so many that I couldn't finish.\n\n*Steak Classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. My BF also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. He did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.\n\n*Steak Au Poivre ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. Our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. I was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here. \n\n*Prime Cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. This is a Mon Ami Gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. Medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. Instead of fries, my dining companion got French green beans on the side. \n\nWe concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. The whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. It's one of the best value on the Strip. Make sure you have a reservation. I always have dinner here when I'm in Vegas."

You can't beat it. The one thing I must call out is the beef tartar... Honestly, the best I have ever had. Plus, you get a generous portion. I suggest a red Rhone to accompany it. Bon appetite!"

The fish and chips were 20 dollars and it's not on the menu. The french fries tasted like deep fried oilly potato skins and the fish was pan-fried without seasoning  (very plain...and I don't think its fresh either).  the Cobb salad has a weird taste that gave me a bad after taste (ew...hate it so much).

So the bill came out to be 53 dollars for fish&chips/cobb salad/2 coffee. \n\nAnyways, the only comforting thing was that the host and another waiter were very friendly and helped us to get situated at a better table than the original one that we were suppose to be seated at. \n\nSo overall, please do not order Cobb salad and fish&chips... Because you really don't want to waste your money on those two seriously not delicious (I am trying hard not to use the word that starts with the letter D...) dishes..and I have to say its not only the worst restaurant I have been to in Vegas, but the worst food experience I have ever had (and i'm NOT exaggerating) \nService : 4 stars \nFood: ZERO star if that was an option\n\nHere is a picture of how those two dishes look like... they look okay but tast D_____G.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=z3izxU7Eckk67LFAP1pTVg&userid=S8lmPHaZK1RoSc5gtaZtWw"

On hot days (so half the year pretty much), they have these mist-ers that make sure you're not melting in the sun.\n\nWe came one Sunday mid-afternoon, looking for some nourishment after a uh...late night. We found the food, service, and value to all be superb. A much welcomed respite after two days of straight buffets.\n\nThe onion soup is a must. It feels like there's a whole onion and a whole block of cheese in the soup, in the best way possible. Certainly not for the faint of heart. I also really, really enjoyed my kale salad (with a poached egg on top!). The steak frites my friends ordered were huge in portions, and were actually really well-cooked.\n\nOverall, this place is amazing value for its price. A french restaurant with really tasty food on the strip with a view of the Bellagio fountains?! That's hard to beat."

For one, the service is always impeccable. The location can't be beat, with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and truly top notch people watching. I particularly like watching the drunk bambi-legged girls (\"weenie wobbles\") trying not to fall in their too-high heels :) Or even worse, the ones holding their heels and walking down Las Vegas Blvd in their blackened bare feet *shudder*\n\nThe Onion Soup au Gratin ($9.95) is a definite must-have. The broth is rich and savory, packed with perfectly soaked baguette slices and caramelized onions, and topped with about a pound of melted gruyere. I crave this soup even when it's triple digits outside; it's that good. \n\nAnother staple is the Filet Mignon Merlot ($34.95), which comes with a merlot infused butter and a red wine reduction. The filet (medium rare for me) is always perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. I don't personally care for the frites that everyone raves about, but they've always been super accommodating about switching it out for another side at a small upcharge. I've had the pommes puree, garlic spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni au gratin - all amazing. \n\nI'm always way too stuffed for dessert, so I won't comment on those. They also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass. And if you stop by for brunch, the build your own Bloody Mary cart is a godsend! \n\nBottom line: don't miss out; this place is amazing! Ask for a table on the patio and come hungry!"

  "text" : "Dinner Review:\n\nI love this place!!\n\nFOOD: Daily oysters were so delicious. So fresh, juicy, and oh so slurpy haha. They were medium-sized oysters. \n\nDuck Confit was impressive. The meat was so tenderly cooked, it just flaked off when you pick at it. It had some dried fruit with balsamic vinegar, together they tasted amazing, but separately, the fruit was extremely tangy. The duck meat was sooo juicy and savory. \n\nFrisee and Bacon Salad was really good. It had more of a crunchy texture with a poached egg on top. It was so simple, yet so flavorful. It was a nice addition to add to your meal. It was very light.\n\nBone-In Ribeye was cooked perfectly to our liking. Seasoned very well. A perfect steak is when it's seasoned so well, you don't need any sauce, and this is it. It was so moist and flavorful. It came with thinly sliced fried potatoes that added a nice flair to the dish. \n\nI was thoroughly impressed with every dish we ordered!\n\nSERVICE:  Service here is amazing. The waiters and waitresses are so nice and attentive. We had a show to catch and was on a time constraint- but they were so quick to serve all the food on time and gave you the check quickly without pressure. \n\nAMBIENCE:  For dinners, I recommend coming early so you can snag a nice spot in the patio. You will have amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains! If the sun is out, you may get a little sunburn and sweaty though...  Indoors was really cute too. The decor is very french-like. \n\nBon appetit!"

It was exactly what my over-taxed little pea-brain needed on that hot day -- somewhere dark and quiet where I could have a leisurely, quality lunch with attentive service.\n\nLocation was great.

The ambiance here is nice and seems upscale, but everyone is wearing shirts and shorts. At the time I had shorts and a bro tank on. You CANNOT wear a tank here if you are a guy! They will make you put this ridiculously large white shirt on. I matched the damn tablecloth... It's a good thing I don't get embarrassed easily, but I did think it was dumb to not allow tanks during lunch. I understand dinner, but not lunch.\n\n===Service===\n\nSince we had a little mishap with the shirts the service here lacked as well. They probably figured a group of Asians coming in and not even wearing the proper attire won't tip much. They took forever to come and take our order or to give us bread. Everyone else around us was getting great service except us. Poor customer service.\n\n===Food===\n\nSteak classique: Steak frites with a maitre d'hotel butter. The steak was very reasonably priced for the size. It was larger than I expected and for the most part it was tender. The butter was green and I'm assuming it was blended with parsley and some other greens to give it that color. The butter was surprisingly flavorless. I had to add some salt and pepper to give it more flavor. The fries were more of thinly sliced potatoes, but they retained way too much oil. They definitely didn't take out the additional oil on the fries. The dish was good for the price in my opinion. The flavor was the thing that killed it for me though. 3/5\n\nAverage food with a nice ambiance in Vegas. There's too many other places with good food in my opinion. Most likely won't come back here."

  "text" : "First off the food was delicious, but secondly our service was phenomenal.\n\nMy friends and I dined at Mon Ami on a Tuesday morning (about 11 AM). We were seated in an area that was kind of outside, but also inside (because they had all the glass windows open to the outside dining area). I was quite pleased with out seating because it afforded us a view of the outside, but kept us from the literal \"street-view\" of the Strip. \n\nOur server was a congenial lovely woman who definetely has a knack for serving and making her guests feel at ease. Throughout the entire meal she refilled coffees, brought Diet Pepsis out without us having to ask, and truly made an effort to romanticize our lovely French dining experience.\n\nWe started our meal with the Escargot, which were swimming in a potent pesto and garlic sauce. The snails' texture was spot-on, not chewy, simply a good mouth-feel, and the garlic, while very prevalent, added to the escargot, it did not distract.\n\nMy Onion Soup was served with the appetizer and I was fairly happy with the soup. I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking. The crouton and cheese ratio was a bit off, with there being a just a *tad* too much cheese. I almost felt bad leaving some of it in my cup, but I had really had enough of it as I got toward the end of the cup.\n\nAs for my main dish I stuck with a classic - Quiche Lorraine. The flavors were mixed well - not too much of any ingredient, and the crust was classic - flaky, but not too crunchy or over-baked. Perfect for a quiche. The quiche around the outside was a bit dry, but as you moved inward it became a much better mix of eggs and cheese. \n\nI ended with the Chocolate Mousse - a refreshingly light dessert, yet it is chocolate so it has that little bit of decadence you want with a dessert. It has little crunchy Kit-Kat like chocolate balls on top of it and is served with some amazing whipped cream on the side. I also sampled my friend's chocolate tart and believe me, that dessert is absolutely worth every penny. I sampled the Bananas Foster from my other friend's plate that too was absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall I must say Mon Ami had good food with just a few minor flaws, but the pristine service made up for it. 5 Stars indeed."

Very clean simple dishes that are executed perfectly. Not pretentious at all. \n\nMust try's: steak and frites, chicken paillard, soup du jour, bread pudding.\n\nYummilicious factor - A+"

  "text" : "i would have given this restaurant 5 stars, but i cant because they dont seem to have basic restaurant manners. dined 07/28 8:00pm\n\n#1. reservation was at 7:30pm - bf and i arrived at 7:15. waitress tells us that they are extremely busy, so even with a reservation, we need to wait 20~30 min past 7:30. OK b*tch, whats the point of calling a week ahead for reservations, if i need to wait. restaurants shouldnt over-book peak times. \n\n#2. our server came back twice. once to take our order and once to ask if we wanted dessert. never came with diet coke.\n\n#3. the lady next to us huffs and puffs into the table, she was in an extremely crappy mood bc she thought a corner booth was a HORRIBLE spot to sit in. then she takes out her phone and proceeds to turn on her FLASHLIGHT to look at the menu! :O she left if on for over 15 min. every single time she twitched, the light reflected off her glass of water into my eyes. at this point im about to flip her table, but i dont want to ruin everyone else's dinner. i call over a waiter, couldnt get his name, but he is the tallest bald one of the night. this douche grins, then tells me he cant tell her what to do. im not pissed bc he didnt do anything, im pissed bc of the way he handled the situation. 20 secs later, i see him walking to a bunch of waiters and waitresses near our booth - he laughs, they laugh. fuck this guy. \n\nthere are 2 reasons i am giving this place 3 stars:\n      1. food was good. \n      2. i saw the restaurant manager? guy in a suit? he grabbed the diet coke for us, brought us extra bread, and asked if we were enjoying our meal. \n\nNEVER AGAIN."

I had mine medium well and my friend had hers medium. Mine was cooked perfectly that after two or three chews it literally melted in my mouth! Crazy good! Usually when you say medium well they only hear the \"well\" part and they cook it through. Not here! Service was phenomenal. We came on a busy night right before we went clubbing and wanted to be across from the Bellagio water show. They bussed a table and five minutes in we were seated where we wanted. Not to mention that our server came around often to pour more wine in our glasses and such. Excellent service, excellent food. After all, you are in Paris. The small one in Las Vegas. :)"

There is sometimes a wait, but it is well worth the wait. Service here is top notch and we have never had a bad experience. \n\nThey have daily specials which is what I normally order. I had the Bananas Foster Crepes last time. They were fantastic. Paired with some fresh squeezed orange juice and a bowl of Cafe Au Lait and I was in heaven. Their omelets and eggs Benedict are also tasty. I always find myself ordering the crepe special usually though. You must try this place while in Vegas. You will definitely not regret coming here."

Sat right inside beyond the patio with the patio doors open.  Great atmosphere for a lunch.\n\nService - great.  Not the super-friendliest server but was attentive and quickly brought extra sauces we requested\n\nFood - very good.  love the toasty baguette they bring.  Very fresh.  We ordered the mussells and the steak sandwich with frittes.  The frittes take a little adjusting compared to American style fries but they were lovely crunchy with good flavor.  I really enjoyed the steak sandwich with melted cheese and au juis sauce for dipping.  the bun seemed like a french version of pretzel bun.  Mussells were good, but not excellent.\n\nGood lunch experience.  want to go back and try dinner."

You come here for the whole experience, the view is incredible, the servers very polite, very attentive, and being in the f&b industry, hats off to the whole staff. these guys were like a well-oiled machine. They are crazy busy, but work without breaking a sweat. lines out the door, and the patio area (which is where we sat) is extremely tight, when moving back and forth to carry dishes out to serve. I had the caramelized scallops, for some reason i was in the mood for some, and they were juicy, cooked perfect and had a great flavor to it. A downside was you only got four. I would of liked 6 maybe? not sure what type of scallops they were but i know  they can get pretty expensive, but some are also really cheap.It was accompanied by a veggie fricasse. the actual broth/cream to it was great, if I were to be so critical, my only gripe was that this was a 25$ dish, how about putting some exotic veggies in there maybe? something more than just peas and carrots. The bread/baguette was also good, accompanied with it was a type of tampanade/bruschetta consisting of shredded carrots, green onions maybe and vinegar. either way it complemented it well. The server was also nice enough to bring us a different version of the tampanade which had radish and corn, which was also very good, but i liked the carrots better. Despite the little critical things, I was impressed with everything. A great job by this upscale restaurant or should i say french bistro."

Dining on the patio is nice during the cooler months but you can't reserve seating there.  Las Vegas used to noted for it's service however that quality is hard to find anymore. I think that todays generation is getting what they ask for and expect. This restaurant is better than some in other casinos on the strip. Prices are  reasonable when compared to Bellagio and Caesars. Face it if you can get out under 150 (tip included) for dinner, desert, and a drink each for 2 on the strip at a good restaurant   consider that a bargain."

The steak is not the best I've had, not really close.  What you should expect is the sauce and potatoes to compliment the meat and make the meal.

  "text" : "Went to Gabi's last Tuesday before leaving Las Vegas AND fellow Yelpers did not steer me wrong.  Excellent food and excellent service AND, AND AND... (very important for Vegas-on the Strip Restaurants... the prices were extremely fair for the quality of the food.  (Hey, Gabi management.... don't start raising prices cause I said this!!! )  All I am saying is that if you go to some of the dumpy restaurants in some of the hotels, you pay through the nose for food that belongs inside a septic tank before its time.  For example, there is a restaurant in the Rio that wants 28 for a chicken pot pie.. really Rio? \nHad the steak au poivre, trout, and croque monsieur.  One of my guests who had the steak told me it was soooooo delicious that if she were home she would be licking the plate until it no longer needed washing... (a beautiful image). The guest who had the trout said it was the best trout he ever had... and the croque monsiuer was excellent but a little on the greasy side because of all the butter and cheese.  I think Gabi's can cut back a little on the butter since the delicious Gruyere cheese that it is made with provides most of the fat this sandwich needs.  I must share with you that I am a French Onion Soup aficionado.  I eat it here and in my favorite city in the whole wide world---Paris.  Well, I ordered the French Onion Soup at Gabi's and it looked amazingly beautiful-- a tall crock of soup with melted Gruyere cheese perfectly broiled on top resulting in gorgeous spots of darkened Gruyere--yum.  However, then I tasted it.  It was reeking with sugar.  Yes sugar.  So sweet I couldn't eat it.  When I beckoned the waiter to discuss it, he told me the onions caused the sweetness because they were sweet onions.  In response to the waiter's answer, I am going to put on the voice of an irate waiter in Paris. (now use your imagination and think of a balding, older gentleman who has been on his feet for at least 7 hours dealing with American tourists)  They go deep into their throats before saying : 'NOH! (that would be an American \"No\".)  I too say No to the theory that the onions caused the sweetness.  Do you know why?  Because I cook  that's why!  I believe that this soup has been Americanized to address the palettes of some americans (I said SOME so don't write back insulting me!).  They added sugar, lots of it AND because of the color of the soup,  I believe they added some Marsala wine which also provides some sweetness.  The ending of the French Onion Soup saga is that they graciously took it back.  They are a class act.  And did I forget about the service????   Amazing.  One of my guests had their water glass filled 7 times.  I'm not kidding.  AND, AND, And, did I forget to tell you about the Baguette????  Yes,  a complete baguette in a bakery bag--- delivered still warm from the oven presented with a generous portion of spreadable butter.  Yes spreadable --not those hard little bricks most restaurants serve.  And did I tell you we sat on the patio overlooking The Strip?  with misters to keep us cool???  Why did I leave thist to the end?.....  Because the food was the star of the show.   I am SOOOOOOO sorry that I went to Gabi's on my last day in Vegas.... if I had been there the first day, I would have chained my leg to one of the tables on the patio and eaten there every day breakfast, lunch and dinner... I would allow someone to take me to the bathroom every few hours only if they promise to give me back my table upon my return.  Otherwise, I'll skip the bathroom breaks.     Thanks Gabi management and staff for a wonderful experience and having a really great restaurant!"

Considering it was a french restaurant with a large amount of review I figured it was okay to have high standards. Boy was I wrong. \n\nHospitality was great, very accommodating to change my order without any further questions. \n\nI order the Chicken Grandmere and it came out too salty and dry. It was so dry I drank 2 glass of water and gave up after eating maybe an eighth of it. The waiter was generous to switch my order to the Chicken Paillard which came very fast! However the chicken was again dry and the flavor just didn't taste right. \n\nAfter we left, I went to McD to get myself a 10 piece nugget meal."

What made the dinner so enjoyable was the friendliness of the staff, starting with the hostess and ending with our stellar waitress, Tracy.  She checked up on us often without being intrusive.  Our water glasses were filled constantly.  The dishes we ordered included:\n\n-Two bowls of French Onion Soup- very filling with the right amount of melted cheese and bread.  It was on the sweeter side but good.\n-Trout Amandine:  The trout was tasty but just slightly over cooked. The green beans were crispy and well seasoned.\n-Mussels Mariniere, full order with frites.  The creamy white  sauce was delicious as a dip for bread.  The mussels were good but a bit too small.  However, the portion was big. The frites were thin fries that were slightly too crispy for me.\n-Bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream- it typically is one of my favorite desserts.  However, the  bread was slightly too dense. \n\nWe liked the fresh French bread in a bag.  The restaurant is easy to get to- it is across the street from the Bellagio Fountains. The dining room was dimly lit- I would have preferred a brighter dining area.  Overall, we really liked our friendly and attentive server.  The food was good so I would give it 3.5 stars."

Je t'aime Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nLet's start with the physical space - the inside is dark and intimate and is just like an eatery you'll find in Paris, France. There's the option to sit outside on the patio - they even have water misters to cool the place down during the summer months. Or, pick a spot in between - half inside and half outside with great airflow, plenty of light and lots of room. The tables aren't cramped but rather nicely spaced for large parties or small.\n\nThere is a great selection of wine for around $8 to $12 a glass for the cheap stuff. But even those wines are d-lish. You get some bread and butter upon sitting down but don't fill up on it cuz the food is off the hook!\n\nI had me the hanger steak and I almost keeled over because it was so dang good! A huge slice of meat prepared WELL as suggested by our server, Number 55. The rest of my party had other options of steak and one hamburger which was apparently awesome. You also get some pom frites finely cut and crisped to perfection.\n\nThe service was attentive and knowledgeable although I never got our server's name - just saw the number pinned to his shirt. I felt that we were well taken care of. Also, I swear we saw Rod Stewart hiding in plain sight. Hey, performers gotta eat too.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas this will for sure be the first place I think of when it's time to decide where the one fancy meal of the trip will take place. I think my mouth is watering now just thinking about the awesomeness of this restaurant!"

  "text" : "i'm doing it. Going all out and saying FIVE STARS! Yup, the best of the best. I've been here 4 times already (1 breakfast, 1 lunch and 2 dinners). Every single meal was delicious. Every single experience was refreshingly authentic. It reminds me so much of a cafe in Paris. The staff is great and attentive. The food is fresh and tastes.....wonderful. Last night, we started with the warm brie and toast. It was just mouthwateringly fantastic. The carmelized garlic pieces were so good on the bread. Just wow. I believe there was a touch on honey too, so you get the sweet garlic, the warm brie, the crunchy bagette slice and a touch of honey...can you say YUM!\nI had the stuffed vegetables for dinner which was great. The quinoa was tasty, the veggies were cooked perfectly and stuffed with love! We ended our dinner with the Sour Cream Ice Cream and Grand Marnier soaked strawberries. WOOOOOOW. I'm going to say it again, WOOOOOOW. That was so refreshingly. Tart and sweet, cold and tasty, just a lovely blend of flavors. On top of all this fantasticness, I was there with my girl Molly T! We had an awesome time peopel watching, having some laughs, and eating great food. I highly HIGHLY recommend this place."

  "text" : "\"Style, Class, and a Patio to make me come back.\"\n\nMaybe it's cause I'm always on vacation. Maybe the memories, Maybe its the weather  or the good company that I've shared my time here.  On top of this, it's on one of the premier patio spots outside Paris in the dead centre of the Strip. These are some reasons why this is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Then there's the food...let's move on to that.\n\nLet me set the tone: it's a classic French Bistro.  White table clothes, fancy setup, however the vibe is casual so even if you're out there in shorts, you're not totally out of place.  \n\nThere are 3 dining areas: Indoors, Indoors with view of patio, and Patio.  Trust me, you want to sit on the patio and experience some pinnacle views which include the Bellagio, pretty people, and the rest of the strip.  Call in for a Reso if you can, otherwise you may be waiting 1-2 hours on a busy day. Again, for me its worth the wait.  Scared of the heat, well don't' worry, there is appropriate shade and air-conditioning and misters outside!  Even in 40 degrees they managed to keep me cool.\n\nEach table is given fresh baguette and butter to start.  One thing I've noticed is that the bread hasn't always come out hot.  A small annoyance, but something that could be easily remedied with a warmer of sorts.  Save some bread cause you'll need it for something else, stay tuned.\n\nIf you are a professional meatitarian like myself, you will have no problem quenching your thirst.  First off the bat get a steak.  I don't even care which one, just do it.  All three steaks that I've had were beautiful cuts of meat, cooked exactly how I wanted it, and could be cut with a butter knife.  Myself I struggle between the Fillet Mignon Merlot and (if i'm feeling hungry) the 22oz Bone in Ribeye.  \n\nAren't a suffer of Meatabetes like me, then why not try some of the mussels?   A light white wine and herb broth dips very well with the bread you remembered to save.  The mussels aren't as fat and juicy as we're accustomed to in the west coast, so this one dish won't fill you up. Regardless, I love mussels and I loved this dish. \n\nNeed something to wash it down? Their wine list is extensive.  However if you want a refreshing treat on a hot day then I'd try their Sangria. \n\nGive Gabi a try.  You won't be disappointed."

Our first experience here was amazing.  As our second experience in this visit,  it was EXCELLENT!  We dined inside and this place is good as it gets.  \n\nWe ordered the same thing from our last visit and I ordered the right item this time =)  The consistency of the food is just melt in your mouth that you felt giddy and in love with the food.  The french bread is as tasty and fresh that you shouldn't eat too much or you won't have space in your tummy.  The steaks and frites is how we remembered and still addicting as ever.  This is now one of our go to places for dinner because it has made my picky simple palate bf happy.  Plus it's not too expensive either.  Make reservations before coming in so that you don't have to wait too long.  They're available on open table."

  "text" : "After our first decadent evening in Vegas, the first thing on our minds was getting hydrated and nourished ASAP. Our party of four was staying at Paris so it was a no brainer that we'd pay the much praised Mon Ami Gabi a visit for a quick brekkie.\n\nAt 9:30am there was hardly any wait and we all were seated in the glass atrium overlooking the busy strip and Bellagio fountains. With coffee and o2 in hand, we were off to a great start!\n\nOur server was congenial, efficient and helpful with the menu, as well.  \n\nWe went with the famous Croque Madame, traditional eggs and sausage with crispy hash browns, large mixed berry crepe, and corned beef hash & poached eggs, respectively.  \n\nThere was a bit of a wait but nothing too bad and the food was definitely worth the wait! Everything was fresh, nicely plated and the portions were very generous.\n\nOur coffees were always topped off and waters constantly filled without asking, which was nice. \n\nOverall, a fantastic breakfast stop at Mon Ami Gabi. The food was solid, service was on point and the price was very reasonable for the location. \n\nNext stop, sippin on margaritas in our  poolside cabana :)\n\nHappy Eats!"

  "text" : "Our 2nd time here. We wanted to sit in the patio area, but the wait was just too long. Anyway, we already had reservations and were seated within 15 minutes. Once again, service was quick. Note to server: it's ok to smile. \n\nI'm a little disappointed that they changed their drink menu - Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout was no longer available dammit! The fresh loaf of bread with the accompanying carrot slaw was yummy! For the appetizer, we started off with the Duck Confit. Skin on the duck was nice and crisp, and the meat literally fell off the bone. After reading mostly positive raves about the Skate Wing, I decided to go ahead and order it for my entree. Great choice! It has a different texture than fish - probably a little more tender, (similar to scallops), but add the lemon-caper brown butter and the cauliflower purée, and you have the perfect blend of 'just right'. Took my time eating it and savored every bite. I will be ordering this dish again in the future! The wife order the Salmon & Leek Quinoa. She said she liked the fish, but didn't really care for the rice. Oh well, you should have stuck to your favorite dish Veruka! For dessert, the server brought her a complementary profiterole, (since it was her birthday), along with her order of Crème brûlée. I had the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. The bread pudding wasn't as good as I remembered it to be last time. Maybe it's because I had recently discovered the perfect home-made bread pudding (at my mom's house). We'll try again for patio seating after the summer crowd leaves, and definitely before it gets cold in Vegas again."

The menu was unique and the \"Frangria\" was so enticing that I have a whole new outlook on french food. Though it is a French Steakhouse, I had their Sandwich Du Jour (sp) which is the sandwich of the day and it was AMAZING! Bacon, egg, this interesting spread, on delicious bread, with a side of their very unique french fries. Best brunch/lunch sandwich. So filling! They had a ham and cheese crepe I was eyeing but when the waiting deliciously described the sandwich of the day, I just melted. It was perfect. \n\nThen their Frangria was their version of sangria and it had fruit and rosemary! Rosemary gave it a very one of a kind way! I was in heaven. \n\nI am very happy with this trip for a friends birthday and I would like to come back to try their dinner menu! \n\nOHH also a plus, they sell Kronenbourg 1664, which is one of my FAVORITE beers of all time. \n\nThank you for the awesome service as well Mon Ami Gabi. It was a great experience."

We ended up with the soup of the day, french onion soup, 2 hanger steaks (my personal favorite cut) and a roast chicken. Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing! We required no additional  seasoning for anything and were stuffed after the meal. \n\nThe fact that i work in the industry as a chef on the strip and have worked every position in the industry has made me very picky whenever i go out to eat.

Petite salad was very earthy and seasoned to perfection. Main course was a bit of a disappointment though :( Hubby had filet mignon wrapped in bacon (3 pieces) each one being a worst to better cut of meat with unchewable tendons and he ordered it medium and it was pretty raw. I couldn't decide between steak bearnaise or steak au poivre so waitress suggested both sauces on the side. Sauces were tasty but steak was more like a smashed flank steak, but tasty. So as I said it started out great but didn't end on a good note. I heard the place had better steaks a few years ago, unfortunately"

The atmosphere is amazing, mood lighting, but not so much private (we were in between two tables) One side is a booth, and the other side is chairs so there is a long booth with tables split with a space wide enough to allow you to sit down on the booth.  Although there is some indication that this restaurant is not kid friendly, it completely is.  They have a kids menu and crayons, which was enough to keep our kids entertained.  My son loved the pizza!  We also had a very patient waitress. In addition, I have a gluten allergy and they provide amazing gluten free bread before dinner and are very careful with the allergy. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for! I highly recommend."

  "text" : "Probably some of the best service I've ever had - from the hostesses to the manager, and our server. We made a reservation for 1pm right on the rail of the patio for 7 people, showed up with 9 people, and they still were able to accommodate graciously. Service was formal, extremely attentive, personable, and very professional. World-class staff. \n\nFood was very good. I would stop just a bit short of calling it an excellent French restaurant - it's a very very good French-ish restaurant with a focus on seafood and the grill. \n\nHighlights\n- All the food, really\n- French onion soup\n- Baked goat cheese\n- Bone-in rib eyes were near-perfect\n- Actual Caesars (not bloody marys). Being Canadian, this is almost a must when recovering from a night of booze\n\nLowlights (only a few)\n- Wasn't blown away by the quality of the seafood on the platter\n- Sauces that came with the steaks were gross looking and too oily\n- I know what they're trying to do with the fries, but they end up as a bit of an oversalted oily clump\n- Caesar salad was drenched in dressing, but that's what you get for ordering a caesar salad at a French restaurant\n\nAs many reviews note, the patio provides some of the best people watching in the city, as well as a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. \n\nOne caution - men must wear sleeved shirts, a problem for one particular show-off on our team.\n\nTL;DR version: Nearly a must-do when in Vegas for a brunch or late lunch, especially if you like to sit in the sun. I'm sure can be just as good for dinner. Most locals we spoke to say that M.A.G. is excellent, so that's reassuring. Top-quality service, great patio, and very very good food."

Service at the table was great; the food was not.\n\nI ordered the escargot which was average and the French onion soup which was not good.  It was very sweet and bland and there was hardly any cheese.  I was disappointed.  \n\nEverything else food wise was ok.  My fiance got the filet with the red wine sauce, it was also very sweet.

With amazing reviews and 4/5 stars, we expected an awesome dining experience...that which was not the case.\n\nWe were greeted and seated promptly (indoor window seating), however, the hostess that sat us didn't say one word to us on the way to our table. Once we were seated, we noticed that all of our wine & water glasses were pretty filthy and my menu had a small veggie surprise on it. lol. Our server took all of the glasses/my menu away and returned with clean ones.\n\nNow, let's talk food.\n\nWe started off with the Wild Escargot de Bourgogne...I felt like the garlic-herb butter smothered the taste and texture of the snails - even overpowered it. The snails may have been over cooked too. \n\nSince Mon Ami is a French Steakhouse, I went with the Steak Bordelaise medium rare. To my disappointment, it was far from what I was expecting. My heart kind of sank because I was so excited :( The presentation lacked, the sauce was watered down, and the cut was a tougher than what I'm used to. The frites were also soggy because they were soaked in the tasteless sauce. \n\nI sent it back for the Mahi Mahi special, which was ok. At this point, my appetite was ruined and I wanted to leave. Our server wasn't exactly the friendliest guy either and I feel like we weren't even seen by a manager. \n\n2 stars for the location and ambiance. Overall, a horrible dining experience.

The wait time to sit on the outside patio was ridiculous..over an hour wait (and this was around 8:30pm on a weeknight!!) so we opted for an inside table. Here's where the luck came in: most people sit on the patio so they can enjoy the gorgeous Bellagio fountain show during dinner. Our table, while inside, gave us the PERFECT view of the fountains and was very close to the outside patio. So throughout the whole dinner we got to enjoy the magnificent Bellagio fountain show on a beautiful summer night. My boyfriend ordered steak which was pretty good, and I ordered the fish which was okay. The fabulous view really made it a romantic and special night and this place was pretty affordable compared to most places on the strip.

When it is 100+ or the wind is blowing...  or other undesirable weather presents itself...  this place is much less impressive.  \n\nThe food is pricy upscale French / American bistro.  Nothing remarkable but all prepared well.  The service can be spotty at times... but when you have the right day on the Patio...  who cares if you are left waiting at the table.  \n\nThe place is always crowded so plan ahead.  Its not a great meal... but on the right day it can be a great experience."

  "text" : "I made reservations for a party 6 of my really good friends. I volunteered and left the pressure of picking a restaurant up to me so I really hoped my friends would enjoy the whole experience. We were seated promptly and had the pleasure of Francois serving us. Their special feature of the day was dover sole. My first experience with dover sole was at a restaurant in Sedona, AZ and it was amazing. I decided to order the fish and convinced my friend to order it as well. Big mistake....when I used my fork to cut the fish it barely would tear apart. Had to force the fork back and forth to break it apart and the bites were not tender. Im assuming this means the fish was overcooked. The fish was advertised as deboned but I found 5 bones, accidentally swallowing one. I looked over to my friend hoping that my recommendation left her satisfied but sadly she had the same experience, though she didn't find any bones in hers. I am happy to say that everyone else in our party enjoyed their meal, though Im rating this on my own experience. I could have complained or spoken up about the fish but I didn't feel like it. We were all enjoying ourselves and I didn't want to put any bit of damper on our good night."

So hard to get a patio table though, but its not their fault everyone likes to eat outside along the strip while listening to the bellagio fountains across the street.

So when I saw they had a whole separate menu for gluten-free meals, I was totally excited. I ordered their salmon and leek quinoa and OMG it was so delicious. And to top that off, I had a bottle of gluten-free beer :) I want to go back for more.\n\nThe service was pretty good, but I did get the feeling our waiter hasn't worked there for too long. When I asked him for any recommendations from the gluten-free menu he seemed a little lost. But he did recommend the salmon and leak quinoa and said the dish is a little spicy so I ordered it because I love spicy! Funny thing, my dish was not one bit spicy, but it didn't matter because it was delicious regardless! What I am trying to say is I don't think the waiter should have made recommendations of a dish he knew not much about.\n\nAnyways , this is definitely a place you want to check out if you are in Vegas."

Unfortunately we were late by about 15 or 20 minutes.  Not a problem.  We waited maybe 5 minutes and were seated in a great location next to the patio so we could also enjoy the Bellagio water show.  \n\nThe service was great and the food was even better.  My wife and I split the Duck Confit & Fingerling Potato as our appetizer and both ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot (steak lovers:) as the main course.  The duck was a great way to start.  The meat was just falling off the bone it was so tender.  Very impressed, we were anxiously waiting for our steaks and we were not disappoint.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.\n\nThere's really nothing more to say.  Wonderful service.  Great location.  Amazing food."

The inside is a bit dark and dingy looking but overall the food is pretty solid. Went for brunch and I had the chicken & mushroom crepe (pretty good) and the girlfriend had the egg salad sandwich (delicious). Bread to start the meal was also great, however the french fries and chips they served on the side were a bit disappointing. \n\nI was really excited to hear that they had a DIY Bloody Mary bar but this was also a bit of a letdown. They have a few toppings but nothing extravagant which is what I was expecting from the waiter's sales pitch. Maybe my standards are too high when it comes to Bloody Mary's but I wouldn't pay extra for this particular bar.\n\nService was friendly but slow and I had to flag down the waiter numerous times to order, ask for refills of water, etc. I think brunch is the best time to go here and I would go back but not if there was a wait."

I forgot what it was called but it had warm bacon dressing, and a soft poached egg... WOW what else can I want on a salad? Haha seriously, it was bomb. Just enough richness against the clean crisp of the frisee. and.... YUM. I enjoy my salads and this was one of the better salads I've had.\n\nTried bits of their special frites - delicious, like a cross between potato chips and regular fries.

Pretty damn good.\n\nWill be back to try more stuff!"

  "text" : "Ate there with a large group while visiting LV for a conference. \nFirst the food: our dinner was great! Started with the escargot and oysters both of which were very tasty. The escargot was cooked well, not chewy or rubbery but soft,  and delicate. I ordered the steak tartare (come on raw steak, all i can say is yes. . .) it was wonderful, meaty and served with pickles and a whole grain mustard, oh and let's not forget the gems on the plate. the pickled pearl onions, I would have eaten a pound of them if i could. \nthat being said lets talk about the way you get seated. regardless of your reservation time you have to stand in a line waiting for seating. this makes NO sense what so ever. It is an issue that can easily be corrected by placing a hostess stand outside the restaurant, oh wait they have one of those but all they do is say ok now you have to stand in line and check in. So why are they there? No reason from what i can surmise. So we got into line 15 min before our 8 pm reservation. we finally got seated at 9pm! This is an issue that could easily be solved by giving the hostesses standing outside the restaurant the ability to check in people with reservations instead of standing in line. You charge top $$ for food but are the worst at organization of your seating. I will NOT be going back for this reason. there are similar restaurants with similar food with better organization. \n \nJust be warned if you go make sure you get in line and you MAY get seated around your reservation time."

We started with the Brie appetizer as suggested by our waiter (an actual French person). The roasted garlic with the cheese and the bread and the goo and the deliciousness was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. I was very sad to see it go away. I got an order of steak frites..the frites not being exactly authentic to what I've eaten  in Paris but a decent substitution. \n\nThe dessert...berries covered in Grand Marnier....uhhhh could this BE any better? Sour cream ice cream had just the right amount of tang for the sweetness of the berries. Yum! \n\nWhat I like most about Mon Ami though is how reasonably priced it is. Sitting right on the Strip, with a view and a patio, I'd expect entrees to be in the $50 range, and ergo but somewhere I'd be dying to go. But together, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and VERY generous tip? $50 apiece. Not bad for people watching and good food outside on LVBLVD. Très bien."

I can't tell you how beautiful it is to watch the fountain show while feasting on some waffles.  Great times.  If you are worried about the heat from eating outside (we went in August), not to worry.  There are fans with mists to keep you cool.

Not something I would generally order but of the two I enjoyed the spiciness of the country pate.  For desert I recommend the warm chocolate tart.  There were five of us and it was about $30 a piece.  Not bad for a patio lunch in the middle of the week.  Service as always was A+."

  "text" : "One of the greatest French steak restaurants that my entire family enjoyed! We were looking for an affordable place to dine since Vegas buffets are fairly overpriced (and worth it), we decided to try out Mon Ami Gabi. It's located right at the main front of Paris Resort and Casino. It has indoor dining with an intimate feel with dim lighting and candles as the table's centerpiece, but it was really cold from their AC given with Vegas' scorching hot weather during the summer. We opted to dine outdoors since it has the breeze of the AC from inside the restaurant as well as the misting fan for outdoor dining. Outdoor dining is great with the front view of the Bellagio's fountains and pedestrians walking by. The wait wasn't as long (15 minutes) since we had dinner right at 5pm.\n\nThe pricing is very affordable for steak and comes with a variety of selections. I had the Steak Bernaise (popular choice) and it was so delicious. Their sauce that comes with the entree compliments with the steak. Mon Ami Gabi's steak pricing is a minimum at $20s range and the Steak Bernaise was in its $20s range. Great pricing for a steak with quality! The entire time, I was pleased to see how much my family enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi. Their steak frites was pretty good, not the usual side orders of fries as it was thin and crispy. Their in-house french baguette was hot and fresh that my sister had to ask for seconds. My nephew had the Fish and Chips, but it was not the usual fish battered fish and chips. The fish came as a patty form which was well done and not the typical deep fried fish and came with frites. Mon Ami Gabi has received two thumbs up from our family. Definitely will come back to Mon Ami Gabi next time we come to Vegas."

I could never imagine eating on the patio for lunch but maybe a quick drink in the afternoon would be alright.  They do have indoor seating but what makes this expensive meal worth it is the view of the strip, so go late, hope it's a cool night, enjoy the view and LOVE your steak."

  "text" : "This place always seemed so touristy and theme-park like that I was reluctant to try it. I didn't expect to find such a gem! \n\nThe food: \nI started with onion soup, one of the best I've ever had. It was comparable to those I had in Paris.\n\nFor the main course, I had salmon with terragon sauce on a bed of pureed peas, topped with arugula. This is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, very well done. It was flavorful, complex, and well-balanced. This was like Spring on a plate. I loved the fresh terragon cream sauce, it was zesty and refreshing. The salmon was cooked to perfection, slightly crackly and crispy on the outside, moist and tender inside. I have tried to replicate this a couple times at home unsuccessfully. Oh well, guess I will just have to come back here! \n\nFor dessert, I had a warm pear and rhubarb cobbler a la mode. It is possibly the best non-chocolate dessert I've ever had. In classic French style, they had poached the fruit in red wine, which gave it a wonderful flavor. Also, I like my desserts very sweet, and this cobbler hit the spot.\n\nAmbience: We chose to sit in the covered/indoor patio. It is beautifully French. Very classic bistro style. They also have a very French cafe-style outdoor patio overlooking the sidewalk. The view of the Bellagio fountains across the street is also memorable. \n\nService: friendly, but often hard to get your server's attention. Maybe they should have more servers working so they can be more attentive.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: amazing fresh modern French cuisine and wonderful ambience make for a memorable experience. You'll think you've been transported to a Parisian bistro/cafe (seriously)."

I hear that the outdoor seating is a better choice since you get to see the Bellagio fountains across the street but I also noticed the water misters were on and the occasional breeze may spray onto your food and drinks. Nevertheless, the food was pretty amazing. I had the Gabi's fish and frites and the texture of the fried fish was similar to a crab! My friend got the grilled salmon salad and man was it big. I'm not a fan of cooked salmon so I didn't taste it, but my friends liked it! For dessert, I tried the banana foster crepe, SO GOOD but SO SWEET.

  "text" : "I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. We wanted to sit outside so we had to wait 45 minutes. The hostess gave us a pager but it had a small range: we were confined to one small section of the Paris casino, and it wouldn't work outside. We ended up waiting the full 45 minutes (plus about 5-10 more for good measure).\n\nFinally we were led to our table, which was directly across from the Bellagio. Front row seats for the fountains! However, we were also right next to the wait station, so servers were congregating less than a foot from my chair for the entire meal. Awkward, and really close quarters.\n\nOur waitress was excellent. Very friendly, clearly knew the menu backwards and forwards. I got the half order of mussels, and she accidentally put an order in for the full size- she let me know her mistake, and said of course she would only charge me for what I ordered but she wanted to warn me in case I ordered the half-size again in the future and was surprised at the size!\n\nSo the food: the free baguette and butter were great. We both got French onion soup, which was okay. Not bad, but also not great: a little sweet, way more bread than cheese, and definitely not worth $10. I wouldn't order it again. My mom got the steak classique, which was great. I got the mussels, which were mediocre. I wasn't a fan of the wine sauce, there was almost a sour note to it? Again, not terrible but I wouldn't order it again. The fries were good, but cut so thin (and so salty!) they were almost like potato chips. We didn't have any dessert, but the table next to us had the creme brulee and it looked pretty great.\n\nI was not overly impressed with the food, but the view cannot be beat. Lots of people-watching on the Strip, and after 7 pm the Bellagio fountains have a show every 15 minutes. The food was not amazing, but I'd be willing to try it again and just order different dishes. The escargot and the roasted chicken looked promising!"

Every experience is perfect and lovely! You can't beat the view at night, as you can take in the Bellagio fountain show from the patio. It's always busy, and they don't take reservations for the patio, but if you're lucky there is a space. If you're extra lucky, bartender #86 is there. I can't recall his name, but honestly, he and his partner in crime for that particular evening showed my sister-in-law and I the most fabulous night ever. \n\nI can't say enough good things about this place.\n\nOh, and get the white chocolate bread pudding.

The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.\n\nThe **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.\n\nThe decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. \n\nYou will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)\n\nDATE TIP: Oui oui!"

The only thing they disallow, if I remember correctly, are flip flops and sleeveless shirts for men (according to the sign posted up on the hostess' table in the front). I ordered the hanger steak, which was drenched in merlot butter. My boyfriend got the steak bordelaise with caramelized onions in a red wine sauce, and we got a side of green beans to share. I liked his steak more than mine, but everything was so dee-lish-us! I was very surprised how big the steaks were too. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and very tasty with the sauce. The plate also included a huge portion of frites. Prices aren't bad, given the portion size and quality (we spent about $65 after tip for 2 steaks and a side). Probably less expensive than the average nice steakhouse on the strip. Will definitely go back again next time I'm in town."

Which is appropriate, considering it's located at the Paris Hotel & Casino :-). We had brunch here on a Sunday afternoon, so it was obviously very busy. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive despite the fact that she had multiple tables to serve. We started with adult beverages and the onion soup. C'est magnifique! The soup was warm and savory with very robust flavors. Lots of gruyere cheese and baguette slices to accompany. The beer selection is rather European as well. I opted for a Blanche du Bruxelles, a Belgian white brewski with hints of spices & citrus, while my boyfriend had a Kronenbourg, which I have always referred to as the French Miller Lite due to its light lager flavor. For our entrée, we split the seafood crepes.....scallops, shrimp, peas and cream.....to die for! On your next trip to Vegas, this place is a must stop!"

We had the honey & brie, scallops and flat iron steak -- all absolutely delicious! At the end of our meal, our waiter brought us a special cream-puff dessert and wished us the best.

Getting down to business I have 2 things to say: 1) the food is top notch, 2) service is lacking, BIG TIME!\n\nI ordered the Salmon Spinach salad. This was the BEST salmon I have ever had! I spent much of the meal looking closely at the spices on it trying to figure out how they make such an amazing dish. My untrained tongue couldn't figure it out, lol. Everyone I was with loved their meal. This was a prime location for our first meal of the trip, and food was superb.\n\nThe waiter on the other hand, was far worse than any I have had in a long time. He was so distant, and disinterested with us. I felt like us being there was inconvenient for him, oddly enough. And gratuity was automatically added for a party of 5?!?! Gladly he wasn't able to ruin our experience with his attitude.\n\nFood is phenomenal, service is disappointing. Hopefully they keep cooking this good because that and location is all this place has going for it."

I said it twice and the hostess barely acknowledged me and was more concerned with me getting our entire party into the tiny, packed entry way to prove all of us were there.  We proceeded to block traffic with the wheelchair so no one old get in or out which really didn't seem safe and made a number of people trying to leave angry.  The hostess, however did not seem to care.  \n\nOnce we were seated I ordered specialty martini for $12.50 and while it tasted good it was very light on the alcohol.\n\nMy husband started the meal with the chilled apple and celery soup with creme freche and sprinkled dill.  It had a nice flavor and consistency. \n\nFor dinner my husband and I both ordered the filet.  I chose the merlot and butter sauce and he went with the creme freche.  Both steaks were cooked nicely and were very tender.  I had the frites (fries) which were seasoned better than the steak in my opinion.  My husband had the macaroni gratin (Mac and cheese).  We both agreed it was ok.  Nothing bad about it just nothing spectacular.  Other people in our party had hanger steaks, salmon and burgers.  Overall, the salmon with green beans seemed to get the best reviews.  \n\nWe ended our meal with the chocolate torte with salted caramel ice cream.  The torte was bitter but the ice cream helped to cut the bitterness.  The ice cream was delicious. \n\nThe best part of our meal was our server.  He was very attentive and all of our food was prepared correctly.  He answered all of our questions and we never had an empty glass.\n\nAll in all it was an ok experience, but for the price I'll definitely choose a different restaurant next time."

He worked energetically as if he had just started his shift when it actually was past the end of his shift (11:30 pm).

Great sauce, pretty salty (I'm sure finishing the french onion soup beforehand added to the salty taste), and pretty fatty. I had difficulty cutting into it. Would not recommend this cut of meat. \n\nThis place has wonderful atmosphere and I'm sure it's even better on the outdoor patio, for another day when it's easier to grab a spot without a long wait.

Since they were served in a gravy boat on the side (and the same price), I asked to switch to the bleu cheese sauce, MUCH BETTER. The steak it self had a GREAT seasoning. Both steaks had a side of fritas/thin French fries? Which were DELICOUS but TOO much. My advice is share and fritas with some one and get another side. It almost left you feeling like the great steak was lacking as a meal. Some veggies? Something would have been nice as an addition. (this is the reason for no 5 stars)"

One of the nights, we decided to try Mon Ami Gabi because of all the rave reviews we've been reading and hearing about this place, so I made a reservation for dinner service. We were promptly greeted and escorted to our table when we arrived, had our orders taken, and quickly served bread and butter. So far the service and experience had been good up until the point at which we receive our food. My friend asked for his steak to be medium rare and it came out medium. Okay, not a problem since this is a French steakhouse maybe they messed up because too many people ordered it and they just forgot. So we sent it back to the kitchen and he received another steak. The new steak is then cut into and we found it disgustingly BLUE and for the people who don't know, blue means the steak was RAW on the inside. I had to speak up and ask our waiter to cook the steak another time and insisted it be medium rare this time around before my friend finally receive the steak cooked to the temperature that was requested. What angers me is how the staff handled the situation, no deep apologies, comps, perks or anything. In addition, how the hell does a French STEAKHOUSE not know how to cook steak?!!?!? Let's just say this place will definitely not be getting my business after this horrible experience."

Ask to sit in the cafe area if you aren't sitting on the patio.  You can enjoy the best of both worlds (air condition and the fountains)!  We ordered the lamb and also the filet mignon and they were great!  The service was great too!  Be prepared, because some of the waiters are French and at times difficult to understand, but remember you are dining in a French Steakhouse inside of Paris restaurant!  I will be back and it was a great dinner and a great dining experience.  Prices were also responsible.  Great place to have dinner on the strip in a prime location."

  "text" : "A weekend jaunt to Vegas with friends to celebrate a birthday weekend ended up with dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. I love this place. We had a reservation, as there were about 12 of us. They would not seat us til all of the party was there. We opted to wait in the crowded bar and have frenchy little drinks til we could be seated. The waitress was awesome! I have multiple food allergies and she first took down, patiently, what they were, so that no cross contamination would occur in the kitchen process. This was a Saturday night and it was packed! She gave me pointers on what to order and there was also a gluten free menu. The menu actually had more than just a few items too and gluten free bread was served with olives just like the other gluten lad bread. Gotta say, I was impressed. I had the filet au poivre ; so good and tender. We had mussels for an app, duck confit and cheeses, as well. Everything was amazing. The creme brulee was a bit boring. All in all its a great place with a great view of the fountains if you get the right seat in the dining room, as we did OR out on the patio. There are warmers, in case of chilly nights. Make a reservation! This place gets busy!"

The  first to arrive was the bread, and I have to say, for unflavoured bread (no garlic, no cheese, etc.) this was pretty fantastic. Nothing but purely delicious and fresh bread with some fresh butter! \n\nThe escargot was soooo good, and served as amazing dipping sauce for my bread after. The liver mousse pate was amazeballs. Really. It had perfectly smooth texture and came with tiny pickles and olives that were a great offset for it.\n\nWould definitely come again, especially for that pate!"

The food on the other hand was so so .But then again, I got their onion soup, and perhaps I should have gone with something else, but my throat wasn't feeling so good so I decided to get something warm. The cheese was all clumped together as one huge chunk, and there was a large piece of bread stuffed inside the soup that was soggy. The soup itself tasted just ok, but slightly salty for my taste. The brie cheese with chestnuts was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to come back to try more food from the menu, and you really can't beat the scenic view."

It was cooked medium rare, but it was chewy, not juicy, and not really that flavorful (even w/ the super bland bearnaise sauce).  You know it's a bad meal when I think it's not even worth my company's dime (thank you, business trips, for saving me the pain of spending my own money).

I greedily slurped down the soup du jour - a carrot/ginger combination that went down like baby food - and ordered the filet mignon au poivre for my main course.  To die for.  The meat was cooked to order and I was only saddened that I couldn't finish because I was so full!  He had the NY strip prepared with carmelized onion and red wine sauce - and it too was amazing.  Both meats were served with the best hand-cut frites I've ever tasted... both crunchy and soft, flavored and oh so yummy... I'd go back just for those.  \n\nWe shared a bottle of Cotes Du Rhone and skipped dessert because we'd made reservations upstairs for Pistachio Souffle at the Eiffel. \n\nExcellent meal.

The onion soup was very sweet, when I complained the waiters told me it's the Spanish onions and not sugar.  But it was to sweet for my taste she took the Onion soup away but did not take it off the bill. The crepe was good with lots of shrimp and scallops. The best part was the baguette, we ate 2 of these baguette with butter and jam. The coffee was weak and slightly warm to the touch."

Never thought we would need a reservation as it was not a big Vegas (4th of July, Memorial Day, New Years, etc) weekend, but there was a wait.  They said it would be less than 15 minutes and they were right.  So, it wasn't horrible.  The weather was great so we decided to sit on the patio, but be advised, it's CROWDED out there.  They really cram you in.  \n\nWe shared the chicken liver pate, escargots and oysters for appetizers.  The winner for me was the chicken liver pate.  Velvety and rich, but not overly so.  I will say, I don't think they serve enough crustinis with it, so I recommend you either order more or immediately ask for more from your server.  We got more bread very quickly, service was spot on.  The escargots were cooked well, tender and flavorful.  The garlic herb butter they serve them in is fantastic.  The oysters were solid, nothing to write home about.\n\nTo eat, I had the prime steak sandwich.  The horseradish cream left something to be desired, not nearly as much heat as I expected from a horseradish dish.  The steak was not thinly sliced which made it more difficult to eat.  It also needed more seasoning.\n\nOverall, it was a good, but not spectacular meal.  I would return, but may sit at the bar or inside."

  "text" : "Boyfriend had specifically requested that we go \"somewhere breakfasty\" Thursday morning when we were in Vegas, so I hopped onto Yelp and came up with Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nWhen we walked up to the hostess, we were informed that there was a 15 minute wait to be seated outside, but that there was no wait to be seated indoors. Naturally, both of us feeling starved, we decided to sit indoors. It was starting to get hot outside anyway. So I'm a little surprised when I'm handed the blue electronic seating buzzer thing and told that I can't walk past the indoor bridge with it because of the range. What? I thought there wasn't a wait! But whatever. Boyfriend and I explored for about 10 minutes before our buzzer went off.\n\nOur hostess then promptly led us to our seats... on the outdoor patio. I'm so confused at this point, but the heat really isn't as bad as we thought it would be, and we have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, so I can't exactly complain. I ordered the Classic Quiche Lorraine and I'm pretty sure Boyfriend ordered the Warm Chicken and Brie Sandwich.\n\nThe quiche was the size of my face! And Boyfriend's sandwich looked very yummy. We each also got a beer. I think my favorite part of the meal, though, were the hand-cut fries. Sliced so thin so as to almost be chips, each fry was like that super-special, extra-crispy fry from McDonald's everyone fought for. You know what I'm talking about.\n\nIt was a tad pricey (~$50 for lunch for both of us after tip), but I think it was worth it to try such a highly-rated restaurant on the Strip."

  "text" : "I am a Vegas local that manages top restaurants, lounges and nightclubs on the strip (not associated with Mon Ami Gabi or it's parent company) and I happy to refer to Mon Ami Gabi as my favorite \"go-to\" restaurant in Las Vegas. \n\nI have eaten at this restaurant more than any other local establishment. I get comps at other locations and pay full price at Mon Ami Gabi and yet I still choose to go there. Food, service and atmosphere are that good. It's my spot and hey always treat me well. \n\nHave never had mediocre or bad service. They are very attentive and the floor runs like a well oiled machine. This place puts some serious numbers through the doors on a daily basis. Large space and you will find that every table is sat for dinner seven days a week. I suggest a reservation. They do not take reservations for the outside terrace on the strip that overlooks the Bellagio fountains. Although a true local will figure out ways to get a spot out there w/o waiting with the tourists. \n\nA must try is the \"Baked Cheese\" appetizer. It is a heaping piece of warm goat cheese in an amazing red Italian sauce and spices. Comes with two pieces of fresh warm garlic bread. This has got to be one of the best appetizers in the city! \n\nThey also have great oysters. Always order half a dozen as an appetizer. Tasty! \n\nThe steaks are the winner here. They are as good as the meat served in the finest steakhouses in the top casinos. Order mushrooms or creamy spinach as a side. Two - three people can share a side item. Save room for dessert as that is also the bomb! \n\nOnly have three minor complaints - \n1) Tables in front of the kitchen doors are not ideal and very annoying. Refuse to be sat there as he swinging door will open and close hundreds of times during your meal. \n2) The paper on the table tops is tacky. We deserve a cloth. You can afford to change them.\n3) BRING BACK THE FISCHER BEER!!\n\nThat is it. The price is super affordable and reasonable. Try Mon Ami Gabi and I promise you will not be mad about your decision. If you frequent this establishment than consider becoming a member of the Frequent Diners Club. Really pays off!\n\nI am going to try brunch for the first time since moving here seven years ago. Stay tuned for that review..."

The inside of the restaurant was quite dark, and it was a bit chilly outside, so where we sat was perfect.  I have given 4 stars instead of 5 because the coffee was extremely inconsistent.  The first cup was so weak, it tasted like the original McDonalds coffee from years ago.  Since I was still not feeling the caffeine buzz that I needed, I figured a second cup of weak coffee wouldn't hurt.  But the second one was actually excellent.  Hoping for another excellent cup, but the third tasted burnt.  Coffee should not be so difficult, the food was excellent!  I tried my friend's quiche, it was a little too salty.

The lovely Dyanna and I recently decided to have brunch and day-drink to celebrate my birthday on the beautiful patio. \n\nReservations are not accepted for the patio, so we made a reservation for 10 am on a Saturday for inside seating, but when we arrived the wait for the patio was short so we decided to sit outside instead. The sweet hostess suggested we wait at the bar where the awesome bartender hooked us up  with glasses of vodka so we could visit the bloody mary bar. \n\nOh and what a bloody mary bar it is! Anything you could want in your drink is available for you... Multiple types of bloody mary mix, multiple brands of hot sauce, more veggies than you can stuff into your glass... I was in heaven. \n\nThe 20-30 minute wait we were told for the patio ended up being more like a 10 minutes wait. We we lead out to a great spot on the patio with what would have been a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains... had they been operating at the time. If you are trying to enjoy the fountains as you dine do not make the mistake we did and go too early! (The fountains start at 3 pm weekdays, noon Saturday and 11 am Sunday)\n\nDespite the mixup with the fountains, our meal was fabulous. Both Dyanna and I ordered one of the daily specials. Lemon pancakes topped with blackberries and peaches. So light and refreshingly delicious! The pancakes are ultra thin, more like a crepe. Because we were celebrating my birthday, our waiter also brought out complimentary profiteroles for dessert, which was a lovely touch. \n\nOur meal, with multiple trips to the bloody mary bar, was quite inexpensive for dining on the Strip. I absolutely plan on making many return trips to Mon Ami Gabi, and will not make the same mistake regarding the fountains!"

The melted goat cheese sounded interesting but the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the mediocre excessive marinara sauce which tasted like it came out of a can.  The onion soup was good however. I ordered pepper steak, which turned out to be pounded thin.  I have never had pepper steak like that, and was told it was to make the steak more tender. My interpretation was that the quality could not have been that high. As well, there were only about 10 peppercorns which I had to search for. Initially I thought they brought the wrong dish. \nMy wife had the salmon on quinoa which was satisfactory but not exceptional. \nThe service was OK, although the waitress seemed disinterested in my comments on the steak. \nI would return perhaps for an appetizer and a drink, without high expectations, just to be able to sit out and people watch (and see the Bellagio fountains) on the strip.

The waitress told us to wait on the side.  So if you have reservations, shouldn't you be seated at most in 5 minutes?  We had to wait an extra 10 minutes.  After that, the hostess said, \"party of 8?\"  uhhh no party of nine. \"please wait one moment.\"  more and more and more waiting...Finally we sat down at 11:45am (15 minutes of waiting).  We pretty much had the worse seats in the house.  Outside, in between the restaurant inside where people walk in and out.  We got the whiff of wind constantly blowing at us because of the breezeway.  Already feeling a little upset....\n\n2 loafs of bread was brought out with butter, and we all had water and one ice tea.  10 minutes later, our orders were taken.  Mind, you, we finished the bread in less than 5 minutes with 9 girls.  Waitress came back with our waters and ice tea.  10 minutes later, refilled ice tea...another 10 minutes later, brought out knives for those who needed them.  15 minutes later, grabbed our small plates which we ate our bread on.   10 minutes later brought out condiments such as ketchup, butter, and jam. we asked for more bread as well since we were all starving. We have been waiting for our food for about 45 minutes already.  It was taking forever...and the service was pretty poor too.  Finally we get our food, along with the bread we asked for earlier, We were angry because once the food came out, the majority of our plates were kinda cold.  The only hot thing was the burger my friend got and they probably made that last.\n\nI ordered the eggs benedict.  Nothing to fancy.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the hash browns.  That was delicious but everything else was mediocre.  A lot of my friends said their dish was okay as well.  I heard the burger was good and they do look good but my tummy was not in a burger mood.  \n\nWe scarfed down our food in about 20 minutes.  Looked at the watch and we were there for about 1.5 hours!  Ridiculous!  This is definitely not a good place to go if you have a large group.  Maybe a few people would be okay but go somewhere else if you have a big party,....even with a reservation!\n\nNOTE:\n-do not come here if you are on a time crunch\n-inside/outside seating"

Great prices for a strip restaurant. must have appitizer Liver Mousse Pate, and steak bordelaise is my favorite. When it's a diet free day I'll ask for roquefort sauce for my pomme frittes. Best dish on their Plats Du Jour is the Beef Wellington. (Was on Thursdays, now on Sundays) \n\nTIP-\n**If you haven't tried the Shrimp Gabi appitizer, you can still order it. Even though its been off the menu for years***"

  "text" : "This review is in regards to breakfast. \n\nI'm a local living close to the strip and this is my favorite place to go for breakfast here in Vegas. The quality of the food per the price is just fantastic. Their breakfast menu is decent and the daily special(s) never disappoint. I've yet to have a sub par meal! I love sitting outside as the sun rises; it's a very peaceful taste of the strip.\n\nPro-tip: if it's a rough morning, the large latte is 3 shots of espresso and served in a bowl!\n\nYesterday's meal wooed me enough to finally write my first review, ever. I couldn't decide between the 2 daily specials so I got a half order of each. (They can split anything on the breakfast menu except the waffles.)\n\nFirst, I had the \"skinny pancakes\" aka lemon brushed caramelized crepes with vanilla poached pears, seared figs, and fresh whipped cream. It was literally to die for!!\n\nSecond, I had the crab cake eggs benedict with hash browns and they were amazing! Eggs benedict is my go-to breakfast order and any of the eggs benedict here never disappoint!"

  "text" : "I've only visited Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast so far, but I enjoyed having breakfast here. They have a large amount of both indoor and outdoor seating, and the servers are very attentive. They seem to work well together as a team (enough that I actually took notice) and I really never felt like I was waiting for anything. \n\nThe breakfast menu offers a great selection, ranging from cereal and fruit to pancakes and waffles, egg dishes, and crepes. I tried the blueberry french toast, which comes with a home-made blueberry syrup and uses home-made brioche as the bread. It ended up a little too sweet for my taste, but the dish was prepared beautifully and came out very quickly. I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice because I felt a little under the weather, but found it a little disappointing. You get a small wine glass of juice for about $4, and it really looked and tasted more like tropicana with extra pulp than real fresh squeezed orange juice. I wouldn't order the juice again, but I could definitely see coming back here again anyway."

  "text" : "I came here last year for dinner with Gardenia H. and Keri W. and I loved it. We were seated on the patio so we had a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains (which were doing their water show) and had this lovely breeze coming through. It was so nice and relaxing to be out there, not to mention enjoying great company and delicious food! We were started off with complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious, although a little hard to eat since we had to cut the bread outselves (they gave us a full loaf).\n\nFor our steaks, Gardenia got the Filet Mignon Au Poivre (creme fraiche) and Keri got the Bone-in Ribeye (22 oz with bearnaise sauce). I no longer remember what their steaks were like, but we unanimously agreed that mine was best. So what did I get? I listened to all the Yelpers on here and got the Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction). I got it medium rare and it was DELICIOUS. So tender and flavourful. I still think it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. And all their steaks come with their signature hand-cut fries, which are also really good. Keri also got Whipped Cauliflower as a side. It was just fine to me (I'm not a fan of cauliflower), but I think Keri liked it. And for dessert, we got their Bananas Foster Crepe (warm bananas, foster sauce, vanilla ice cream). Such a perfect (and delicious) way to end the meal :)\n\nThe patio was a little crowded, but it was still a great experience. They do not seem to have a bathroom inside the restaurant, I was told to go inside the casino and use their bathroom (it was a 30-second walk from the front of the restaurant). Our server was nice and friendly and I had a great time here. This place probably deserves more like 4.5 stars but I'm leaving it at 4."

  "text" : "This rating is more so geared toward service and overall experience and not the food per se (since I havent tried most of the menu).  The two stars I gave were for the beautiful view of the water dance show from Bellagio situated opposite from this restaurant.  \n\nLast weekend I came here for brunch for the second time.  I called in a month ahead to reserve a table, but we still had to wait for almost 20 minutes for a table.  Once we were seated, I realized we had the most unpleasant spot in the entire restaurant.  Why? Well, our table was in the lobby connected to the patio outside.  Therefore, cold air was constantly blasting toward our direction.  Because I didn't know any better, I wore a tank top that morning thinking it was such a beautiful day.  After sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to start covering myself up with the napkin (even though that didn't really help at all).  Aside from the location, the service is subpar.  We ordered our food and it didn't come out for another 45 MINUTES!!! That is ridiculous! Not only was I (and the rest of the girls at the table) cold, I was also hungry for 45 minutes for them to get the food out.  \n\nNow for the food part, I ordered off the brunch menu so I got the corned beef hash and poached eggs with roasted red pepper ($12.95).  Let's just say I was equally disappointed with the food as I was with the service.  My dish came out cold...and you know with poached eggs, they would taste terrible with not warm.  I enjoyed the hash-browns as my side dish though.  \nWould I want to come here again??? NO!"

I'll give this place five stars if they match this great experience every time we visit. At 11 PM on Saturday we were seated immediately on the patio."

The only reason we're not giving 5 stars is that we reserve that for absolutely mind blowing. \n\nMake no mistake, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. We ordered the warm brie,  steak frites bordelaise medium rare, and French Toast.\n\nBrie was perfectly warmed and softened with roasted garlic cloves, toasted macadamia nuts, and Yummy honey drizzle. \n \nThe steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were thin, crispy and delicious. \n\nThe French Toast was made with brioche, just the way true \"pain perdu\" should be made. I highly recommend trying this delicious classic. \n\nWe sat on the patio and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. Overall exactly what you would hope a Sunday brunch should be. A delightful surprise in the middle of the strip."

However, when I got to the hostess desk she told me I could be seated right away inside or there would be a 10 minute wait for the patio.  Patio, of course!  It's a great place to people watch.  \n\nEverything was super on point and the hostess was super nice like asking questions.  Service was also very very nice and everything seemed busy around but it never felt rushed.  I ordered the mixed berry waffles and bf had the eggs Benedict.  Coffees and waters were kept filled and the food came out in a timely manner.  The food itself though was SO good!  The waffles came in 4 pieces with very fresh pieces of fruit.  The waffle batter was nice and thin and stayed crisp on the edges even after I poured syrup on it!  It came with a nice side of whipped cream.  I ordered a side of date bacon and it was so delicious.  It tasted sweet and crisp.  I had a bite of the bf's benedict and he also loved it.  It came with a side of hash browns.\n\nPrices were very reasonable for Vegas food.  I will definitely eat here for dinner next time and try the steak!!"

  "text" : "Since we were staying at Paris, we decided to try this always crowded restaurant for brunch. We were able to make reservations on Open Table just in case, and walked in 15 minutes before our reservation as we were starving. I would have liked to wait for the outdoor seating, but my friend prefers indoors so we had a nice table near the outdoor dining area. Much brighter than the area when you first walk into. The restaurant is much larger than I had expected, and we were seated at a nice table that sat 4 for the 2 of us.\n\nThey gave us a fresh baguette with butter, very delicious, and didn't tear up the roof of my mouth. We decided to get a butter lettuce/argula salad as we needed some veggies from our fatty weekend. All the sandwiches looked tempting, but I had been on an Earls binge, so I opted for the classic quiche lorraine, and my friend had the chicken and brie crepe.\n\nOur server was very attentive and offered a refill on our mimosas, but sadly we declined. Could get 10 of those for the same price at the casino! :) Mimosa was great though, would definitley recommend. Salad was light and refreshing, and their chickpea croutons were superb. My quiche was perfect, a very good size (medium pizza size) and the egg was creamy and delicious. The crepe was a bit too healthy for me, a wheat type of concoction, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. The best part had to be the addition of the french fries. I had read they were like potato chips and they really were. So thin and crispy, anyone who loves crispy fries would love it. They also gave me a lemon aoili and stone ground mustard since I don't eat ketchup.\n\nThere was an annoying fly that wouldn't let us enjoy our meal as much as we would have liked to as we had to keep swatting it away. For the price, everything was fantastic, and I would dine here again as their prices of their steak are very fair as well."

Use the sauce on the bread to savor the taste! \n- Food presentation was great. Matched ambiance of restaurant. \n- Ahi tuna burger was a bit too salty for my liking. The waitress was polite enough to replace my order with the Seafood crepe. \n- French fries was like a fashion chip and French fry. Crispy, flat, and tasty. \n- Seafood crepe was delicious! 2 scallops and 2 shrimps. Very savory. Better choice.\n- Great for a nice gathering when you haven't seen a few friends for a while."

  "text" : "Took my company out to vegas for the weekend.  Made this stop as our company dinner.  Made reservations over a month before.  called ahead and asked how long the wait time for my 8pm reservation is going to be.  They said at 8pm.  I was kinda shocked by that answer.  i said you're on time.  They said yup.  I was impressed by that.  \n\nWalked into paris the well the paris hotel and casino is nice!  The restaurant is to the left when you enter.  As you're walking by the strip you see the patio of the restaurant.  Walked in, got seated in door and ordered drinks for the crowd.  i had the scotch and it was priced at $12 a shot.  Which is avg for a nice spot.  On to the food.\n\n\nI shared my plate with my girl and ordered the bone in rib eye.  other items ordered were the roasted chicken, fish (trout) and the filet.  Ordered the cheese plater for the apps.  Starting off with the cheese plater. Small amount but tasted good.  The rib eye was outstanding!  perfectly cooked. The filet i was told was also perfect.  The trout the wife of an employee couldnt stop talking good things about.  The chicken i had a few bites of and it was also very good.  The spot knows how to get things done.  Thats why they have a small menu. They keep it simple.  \n\nOnly reason why it didnt get a 5 star was because you had to walk into the casino to go to the restroom.  I mean come on people you have a great restaurant and you cant build a restroom in it. You have to make me walk the smokey casino to piss.  Not cool."

  "text" : "I may not been to Paris yet, but dining at Mon Ami Gabi on a lovely night was close enough. Situated with a front row view to Bally's famous water show across the street, my friends and I treated ourselves to a night of great food and company before heading over to the club. \n\nWe made reservations and were seated promptly outside after we requested for a patio table. The atmosphere was lively and bustling and the water show coming on every 15 minutes gave the restaurant a romantic ambiance. Service could not have been better, as our waiter was extremely kind and accommodating enough to run down to grab band-aids for some of us girls who had gotten blisters a little early from our evil high heels. \n\nFor starters, I just had to have the famous French onion soup. I haven't been able to find the perfect French onion soup for a while now, so trying it at an authentic French restaurant seemed like the right place. It came served in a generously deep bowl with plenty of melted cheese brimming on top. Sweet and savory with slivers of caramelized onions and cheese in every sip, I just had to share this with my girl friends. They all had plenty of fun dipping our complimentary bread in the soup. \n\nFor my entree, I'm actually not a huge steak fan so I didn't end up getting the steak, which is what this restaurant is famous for. And I'm sad to say that I slightly regret it. I had the Caramelized Sea Scallops and while they were scrumptious, I have to say that five pieces of medium sized scallops just wasn't enough. It came with some sugar snap peas and carrots on the side but it would have been nice if it came with either another side or a larger portion to round it off. \n\nThe frites (fries) were amazing though, and I would've ordered any of the Steak Frites dishes just to have these. Now if you're familiar with In-n-Out, you know those tiny, crispy slivers of potatoes that are too small to be considered actual fries that happen to taste like potato chips? Try having your entire portion of fries exactly like this! Now that is a dream come true. \n\nA great alternative for good eating if you don't feel like overstuffing your face at the many buffets on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi is the place to go."

We sat on the patio and had a view of the strip sitting underneath the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bellagio fountain show.

  "text" : "Ok, I have no idea where they got those 3000+ reviews and 4 stars but dinner was extremely disappointing. I am actually in the middle of it as I write this. I got the ribeye with Merlot butter and i can honestly say you're better off buying a prime ribeye steak from Ralph's and grilling it yourself. I know this because I've done it and it was 10x better than the ribeye I have right now.\n\nI got the medium/medium rare. The first one they gave me was burnt outside and one inside. Not charred, burnt. It was very bitter. I sent it back and got a new piece. This time, it was cooked fine but it is bland, maybe some finishing salt would've been nice. But the real complaint is that, for a medium rare steak, it is extremely tough! I even asked to make sure they're using prime beef and they assured me that they were but I am chewing rubber and my jaws hurt. Again, the meat you get at Ralph's seems better than this. I'm still hungry but I can't chew anymore so I'm giving up. The pomme frites are pretty good and they were nice about taking the food back, thus, the 2 stars. And I guess the mojito is pretty decent. The merlot butter is just that. A piece of butter floating around in a vat of Merlot. Not horrible but nothing special either. The steak was cheaper compared to other Vegas steakhouses so generally, the saying holds true. You get what you paid for. Definitely not coming back."

Just note that your reservation will NOT apply to patio seating, but you can just cross the street after dinner to watch the Bellagio fountains.\n\nMy sister raved about this place, so we had to try it out.  She wasn't wrong - Mon Ami Gabi is exceptionally well-priced for the strip and the quality of the food.  The complimentary French bread was addictive and our steaks and wine were fantastic.  The tables are a bit close to each other (especially when there is an obnoxious group of 16 seated next to you), but the service was excellent and attentive.  Highly recommended!"

The cut it self was pretty thin, I was expecting more of a normal cut, but for the price it cant be beat.\n\nThey also give you full sized bread baggets at the table when you sit which were nice, I used mine to soak up some of the juices from my steak.\n\nThe fried onion things that came with it were okay, not much flavor, it felt like you were eating/ tasting just air.\n\n\nOver all I would come back again, at the price point the quality/ value is very good, however the wait/ reservation part is banannas"

They do a great job with all the French standards. Nothing too flashy, but consistently good. The steak frites was good. Really enjoyed the cheese surrounded by tomato sauce thing. Mon Ami Gabi even does a pretty descent brunch with make your own bloody mary bar.\n\nOne thing Mon Ami Gabi has that is worth it is spectacular views of the Bellagio fountains. So try to get a seat by the street for the best view.\n\nIf Picasso across the street is way out of your price range, and you want some classic French food, Mon Ami Gabi is a solid choice."

There were 6 girls all at the hostess booth and it was clear they had no idea what they were doing or how to act appropriately. They were confused, giggling, whispering in each others ears (I'm not joking) and overall just rude and completely idiotic. They told us we would be seated immediately yet waited 30 minutes. Many more people started coming in and were told to wait as well, but there was no where for anyone to stand so everyone was crowded in a small space around the hostess booth and were told rudely by the hostesses to move. Anyways once seated, there were about 60 flustered waiters that were all running around yet doing absolutely nothing. One waiter for water. One waiter for bread. One waiter for drink orders. One for food. None would make eye contact when it was obvious we needed something. They also were barely speaking audible English and overall it was the strangest service. Now the food was decent...not anything amazing, just ok. The scrambled eggs were a little bland an cold, the bacon was good, the hash browns were totally undercooked and bland. I was very hungry and hungover so with the right amount of salt and ketchup it was decent. If anything, I HIGHLY recommend the Nutella waffles with homemade whipped cream....wow. Amazing. I'm giving it 3 stars because the prices were very decent ($11.99 for my 3 eggs/bacon/hash) and the location was beautiful. I usually never mention service in my reviews but this place seriously needs some new management. But honestly I feel like 80% of the people that work in Vegas are strange, confused, rude and stupid. Not to be mean....but I've gone twice and always notice how incompetent everyone is."

The taste and price for the courses are unbeatable!  If you get a good seat on the patio you could watch the water show at Caesar's Palace - really romantic!  I've been here for anniversaries, birthdays, New Years, and well... any time I can actually.  \n\nMy two favorite must-have dishes are:\n\nFILET MIGNON MERLOT\nFor steak, you MUST order this particular entree.  It is the only one I love to eat and only $35.   Compared to the other steak restaurants in Vegas this is a fantastic deal and the red wine reduction sauce is savory and not too heavy.  All steak dishes come with some crunchy thin steak frites that were kind of weird at first but I eventually learned to love.  Please order this!  I've tried almost all of them and the Filet Mignon Merlot is the best!\n\nBAKED GOAT CHEESE\nI recently had this dish and for something so simple I was blown away.  All it is is delicious goat cheese in a warm tomato soup served with fresh garlic bread.  I was so heartbroken when I couldn't eat this again because I was short on time my last trip :(.  This is an amazing starter/appetizer  I am determined to order it on my next visits to LV.\n\nThe free bread and dip they serve at the beginning of the meal is delicious as well.  Almost everything I've tried here was made to perfection and I was never disappointed.  \n\nCHEF TERRY LYNCH... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for your expertise and wonderful talent.  You are truly a culinary genius and it's no wonder this place got such rave reviews.  The truth is.... I FREAKING LOVE YOU!  There, I said it."

That was full of cheesy deliciousness, one of the best french onion soups I've had in awhile.\n\nI also tried my friend's Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn) and Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onion & red wine sauce), and ultimately their sauces were satisfying, but I just didnt enjoy the steak itself.\n\nAlso, the two guys I was with were both wearing tanks and had to wear a huge white t over because apparently a tall t is so much better.\n\nOverall, not bad but maybe I should give it another shot before jumping to conclusions.

I have to complain about the bacon too, it was overcooked and was not a fan of the hash browns.  \n\nI did not complain about them not taking the meal off my bill because I am on vacation and did not want to bother with arguing the fact that a hair in my food is disgusting, but I definitely will not be returning here!"

It's great for a group of friends, a date or families.  It has one of the most unique views in town and a genuine French feel.  I am not familiar enough with French food to say whether it is authentic or not, but I can say that all the food is awesome.  Even the French bread that comes with every meal is great.  \nThe patio doesn't take reservations so if you are in a hurry ask for atrium seating otherwise the patio is worth the wait!"

I am not talking about the street performers and the local wack jobs but rather the folks from flyover county. It is shocking to see what they pack to wear...and then how they matchy-matchy and accesorize. \n\nlost my train of thought...Mon Ami is a good choice...yes pricey...but the food is solid...the drinks more than adequate...and the service top notch. They leave you alone as long as you are spending (drinking)...but the minute you think you're going to nurse your drinks...then you are moved to the bar. The patio real estate needs to be turned on a perfect 75 degree day in November.\n\nRomance, business, lost your shirt at the tables, just tired of shopping or talking football spreads and over/unders...its a great place to stop mid-strip."

  "text" : "Very disappointed after hearing good reviews about this restaurant. This was an anniversary dinner for my wife and I and we were looking forward to a nice evening. \n\nFirst, I called in our reservation and noted it was our anniversary, but when we arrived (after waiting in the 'reservation' line for about 45 minutes) the hostess could not find our reservation. Not a big deal right? I told them I made the reservation over the phone. They told me no problem they would seat me in just a few minutes. They ended up seating us at the worst table of the house, right behind the hostess stand. That wouldn't do for our anniversary dinner so I asked why we had such a poor table? The hostess replied that since we did not have a reservation, walk-ins get seated in the bar lobby. I reiterated that we did make the reservation, but that they somehow lost it. The hostess's reply? 'Well, I didn't lose your reservation.' I asked to speak to the manager.\n\nSecond, the manager comes up to the hostess stand. After a minute or two of whispers and checking their computer, she comes up to me and says, word for word 'And you are here for?' Seriously? As a manager THAT'S how you begin your interaction with a guest? I explained that what I was there for was for our anniversary, I made the reservation over the phone and I was not happy with the table they offered me. She responded by saying that they were very busy and that all walk-ins are sat in the bar area since there were no other available tables. After explaining, again, that we had made the reservation over the phone, the manager gave me a quick nod and said something to the hostess. No apology, not even a word of acknowledgement. The hostess sat us at a table in the solarium area.\n\nThird, the food is nothing special. There are plenty of other restaurants in Las Vegas that have better steaks and seafood. Eiffel Tower restaurant, Prime Steakhouse, Seablue, and Picasso just to name a few. I'm not saying the food was bad, but nothing to go out of your way for.\n\nOverall, if it wasn't for the horrible experience with the hostess and management (our waitress was actually very nice), we wouldn't have been impressed with this restaurant at all. Spend your time and money someplace else."

Some noteable items:  the frisée/kale salad with bacon, topped with a perfectly poached egg, was seasoned to perfection. I didn't want the salad to end.  The fries were like big potato shavings, fried to a delightful crisp with the right amount of salt.  I could not stop eating them...and poached some from a friend's plate even after the meal was through.   The French onion soup: divine, with caramelized onions melting in your mouth, rich, savory flavor, with gooey melted cheese......yum!!! Quite perfect for a fall evening.

In the end, we left quite pleased with our  brunch experience.\n\nWe started the meal with  a carafe of their version of sangria which was delicious and not too sweet as well as the baked goat cheese. I was a bit surprised by the goat cheese as it was served at the center of an interesting tomato sauce and I had never seen that before. It came with crispy garlic bread which was good but I preferred it with the  baguette that was served at the on set of the meal. \n\nFor our entrees, we opted for a chicken sandwich with caramelized onions and sliced apples and a cobb salad. The sandwich was really a let down. The ciabatta roll it was served on drowned out all of the potentially good flavors and overall the flavors were on the sweet side. The salad however was delicious with fresh avocado, turkey, crispy bacon. The house dressing was a great compliment. \n\nFor the location on the strip, the prices were very reasonable and we left happy. All in all a very decent place to grab a bite and take in the sights of Vegas."

  "text" : "I used to like going here.  It's nothing out of the way special, but was one of the decent places for lunch if you're staying in or near Paris/Ballys.  I was just there with a group this weekend.  I made a rez, and I understand their \"policy\" of not seating a group until everyone is there, fine, but they were pretty snotty about it. All but 2 people out of 8 where present, who would be there within a few minutes, but no budging on seating the majority of the group who were starving after flying in that day.  \n\nOnce everyone arrived (maybe 5 mins after our rez time), it still took them forever to get us a table.  It was busy, but not that busy, there seemed to be lots of tables around.\n\nWe all placed our order rather fast, and food was delivered quite timely.  Except one order which was wrong, and the server (not our waiter, just the guy who brought the food out) said he'd be right back with the correct order.  20 mins later, no replaced meal, no server in sight and our waiter never bothered to check in on us.  I finally flagged him down and he seemed very sorry and quickly got the missing meal.  \n\nI understand mistakes happen in restaurants.  I also understand the importance of taking care of your customers.  While he said sorry, he really should checked in as soon as they meals arrived to avoid this drama, since he didn't do his job of looking after his table he should have comped the extremely late meal, but he didn't.  A better institution would have been very apologetic, not charged for the meal, and would have had a manager come and check in on us.  None of the above was done. \n\nBesides the fact, I've been visiting this place for years, I also feel the quality of the food has gone down significantly.  I had the onion soup, which was fair, nothing great, and the Frisse salad which was pretty sad, too much dressing, not enough lettuce and my egg had undercooked white.  Both items I have had and liked in the past.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back here the next time I'm in Vegas."

We had a 7:10 am flight, got up stupid early, parked, battled the sleepy crowds at SFO, got on a flight full of cranky flight attendants who insisted that we sat where we were ticketed (despite an empty row in front and behind our packed, 3 seated row).  Arrived in Vegas all sleepy-eyed, throbbing headache, and slightly confused.\n\nAfter wandering down the Strip in the rain, in the cold, I realized we were close to this place, and I convinced the fiance that we needed to eat here.  I made a reservation on my phone using Opentable (yay for having a less-dumb phone now), and we trekked it over here.\n\nI am so glad that most of the restaurants in the casinos understand that cigarette smoke + fine dinning = PIECE OF POOP, in experience, taste, texture, and consistency.  That is why this place has one door that opens into the casino, it's small, and lets in as little cigarette smoke as possible.\n\nThe first meal here was a croque madame, chicken liver pate, and quiche lorraine.  Reading the reviews on yelp, I was expecting European portions.  It was not.  It was full on Middle America portions.  \n\nMy Croque Madame had a fried egg on top of two thick slices of smooth white bread, topped with at least 6 slices of salty, flavorful ham, and caressed with cheese.  The fried egg was delicious.  As I cut into the runny yolk, the golden butter-like consistency flowed over the already scrumptious ham and cheese and bread stack and encased the whole thing in a PUT-ME-IN-YOUR-MOUTH, stop thinking and just chew!\n\nThe Fiance's quiche was home made.  The crust was light.  The filling had identifiable chunks of onion, ham, and whatever else is suppose to go in there.  The fries were kind of poo though.  Too thin, like shoe laces.  Wide, but thin.  It was like eating chips.  \n\nThe second meal was the filet mignon.....but I'll save that for my follow up review because I gotta shower and get to work now."

  "text" : "I would give five stars for the location alone! Located inside Paris and across the street from the Bellagio, it offers one of the best views of the fountain show and is a fantastic place to people watch. Even as the crisp winter air approaches Las Vegas, there is no excuse to not dine al fresco as the million heat lamps are out in full force.\n\nI made a reservation through open table for 815pm on Saturday and had no trouble changing it last minute when I realized there was no way I was going to make it. I love technology. Made another reservation for 9 and waited an extra 10 minutes (aka .53783 second in Vegas time) for patio seating. \n\nI ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the steak merlot and daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn I'm hooked. The food came out perfect and I was practically drooling by the time it was in front of me. The salmon was flaky, hot, and the bed of quinoa was just the right consistency, something a lot of restaurants can't seem to manage."

  "text" : "We know you want to sit out on their dining terrace, so just prepare yourself to wait an hour minimum. I wasn't going to wait that long, which undoubtedly took away from some of that ambiance. The food was alright, not necessarily the best. The unfortunate thing is that everyone at the table got a steak of some kind so really this is just a review of their steak dinners. They have quite a few steak options all ranging from the least expensive hanger steak to filets. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I don't think it separates them from any other restaurant in the area. The service was excellent, which is to be expected with the caliber of this place. I'd absolutely go back and try different menu options to get a better idea of the food quality and to try and grab a table outside. If you're enticed by the outdoor dining option, give it a go. If you don't feel like waiting over an hour to watch the fountain show and people watch, but still want quality French food, head over to Comme Ca at The Cosmopolitan. They have outdoor seating and the food is competitively priced."

  "text" : "I'm waffling on this one (Ha! Get it?...it's 'cause...it's 'cause they serve waffles here...).  My fiancee and I went here twice in the same weekend, and the two visits could not have polarized me more on this place.\n\nThe first time was for breakfast with a large group.  We were seated on the patio, but not at a table with a good view of the Bellagio fountain (which is fine by me, because I really have no interest watching water squirt in the air while I'm eating).  It was either due to the promise of 18% gratuity or in spite of that fact that throughout the entire meal we got excellent service.  The food did take a while to come out, but I chalked that up to the large group.\n\nThat meal I got the Quiche Lorraine...and oh dear was that a surprise.  I don't typically like quiche, as my fiancee can attest to (she was surprised I ordered it to begin with), but there was something special about this one.  The flavor was just amazing, and it was nice and soft and moist on the inside, despite looking burnt on the outside.  My better half got a croissant breakfast sandwich, which wasn't bad but I didn't really think it was anything special.\n\nSo naturally after a good experience we came back a second morning...and we should have just left well enough alone.  The food was good: she got a repeat of the quiche which she said wasn't as good though I thought the quality didn't dip that much; I got the steak classique and french onion soup, both of which I enjoyed (although it wasn't my favorite cut of steak, but I realize that cut could be standard for French cuisine, I don't really know).\n\nThe problem was the service...or lack thereof.  Our server was inattentive at best, and most of the time it felt like he considered us a bother more than a customer (we aren't annoying, finger-snapping snobs, I swear).  Whenever we asked for a refill on water or iced tea his response was a curt \"sure\"...not a friendly \"sure\", a \"sure\" that made it sound like we interrupted his day.  I know I'm coming across as snooty and paranoid, but it really was quite bad.  Half the time he spent standing directly behind our table, chatting up another server, ignoring us and the table next to us in the process.  And again, he wasn't busy with other guests, we knew where he was, which was neglecting his job.\n\nThe four stars is for the first visit, because I will give this place the benefit of the doubt.  Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch, as they say...people say that, right?  I may come back one day, though it will be with a wary disposition, which is not a light any restaurant should cast over itself."

  "text" : "OH EM GE!!! No wait for brunch at this place on a Sunday made me super happy especially since I was pretty hungry and ready for some coffee. We were given the option to decide if we wanted outdoor or indoor seating. We opted for outdoor being that it was a beautiful morning after a rainy weekend in Las Vegas. Mon Ami Gabi is located inside the Paris Resort and Casino. \n\nWe were seated by the edge of the patio with view to the Bellagio fountain. Our waitress came over and introduced herself. She also gave us a few recommendations being that it was our first time and specials that were not on the menu. Before I knew it I had my cup of coffee in front of me and was watching one of the few fountain shows from across the street. \n\nI ordered the french toast. I noticed that it said it was served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup, topped with whipped cream.. well I was a bit scared. I am not a fan of blueberries being that I was always fooled as a child (blueberry pancakes are NOT the same as chocolate chips, mom!) I decided to go for it and face my fears especially since I knew already that it was going to be full of blueberries. Lemme tell you this, it was the most perfect french toast ever that I have had in a very long time. The sweetness was done to perfection, the blueberries themselves were perfect, everything about this meal was just magical and out of this world. The french toast was cooked just right. It makes me want to cry of happiness. I could eat this all day, errday and be a happy person forever! I would HIGHLY recommend this dish. I would skip out on waiting for the buffet line any day for this dish here in Vegas. Yes, yes I am in love with this french toast. \n\nIt was a pleasant experience and it became one of my favorite places to be at. The atmosphere, super good food and the great view made me feel like I was not in sin city. \n\nThey also serve lunch and dinner. I would love to come back and have a glass of wine and also try out their Steak Bordelaise, Steak Au Poivre, Creme Brulee, Duck Confit & Fingerling Potato and their Escargots De Bourgogne cause sure whyyyy not..

Found myself in Vegas needing a restaurant that \"takes reservations\" was \"good for groups\" with an \"average noise level\" and Mon Ami Gabi popped up. Everyone pointed out the option to dine out of doors and watch the Bellagio fountains -- such a great idea!\n\nThe service was impeccable - our party of 8 had two gentlemen waiting on us who kept our wine glasses (and bread baskets) full. Per my conversation with the hostess who took my reservation, we arrived 15 minutes early to request patio seating (you can't reserve this in advance). The patio heaters were on in full force, and it was pleasant enough to sit outside without a jacket on (we even had them turn a few down). \n\nFood was excellent (a lot of sampling of your neighbor's plate was going on at our table) -- especially the scallops with the butternut squash and the onion soup. The various steak frites were good -- though the frites are paper thin and not really to my liking, but hey different strokes for different folks. Our waiter helped me to select a nice white bordeaux that everyone quite enjoyed (and at $34/bottle was one of the less pricey selections on the menu).\n\nFor dessert - you MUST get the bread pudding. Holy Moses. I died and went to heaven, and then ate a ton of the profiterole dessert as well. Just do it."

We arrived 5 minutes early pior to our reservation time and didn't get seated until 10 minutes after our reservation time. They seated a walk in reservation before us. I work hosting on the strip as well and I know reservations are first priority not walkins. We made our reservation on open table and specified it was an anniversary and needed a high chair. When we arrived we were still asked if we needed a high chair. I hope a 1 year old baby needs a high chair. It was already in their open table notes as well. Just thought that was a blonde move.\nWe go seated in a rather crowed area where the food runners almost hit us with their trays a couple of times.. A little annoying.. We started with a bottle of Bordeaux that has great taste but it was too cool for my liking. I like my red wines more room temperature than chilled. My husband and I tried the smoked salmon. Those were my favorite! Loved the capers and the créme fresh and I love smoked salmon. We also had the escargot, I only agreed to try them because on our honeymoon in Paris I was too scared. Not bad they were pretty good. My husband said they needed more butter and flavor. I had to try their Onion soup aū gratin since I had the BEST onion soup on Paris my mouth just waters thinking about it. My hopes were too high:( the soup was good but the flavors were not there. The cheese wasn't as texturized and crunchy like in Paris.\n- my husband ordered the chicken paillard that I tasted and loved. It had that perfect delicious lemon vinaigrette! \n- I had the steak classique I wanted a steak with simple delicious flavors. It had an herb compound butter that I enjoyed but the steak itself was like stringy and chewy. It was probably jot the best quality or cut of steak. The frites that came with the steak did not catch my attention flavorless.\n- I ordered mac and cheese so our 1 year old could also experience Mon Ami Gabi. I tasted it just to make sure it wasn't to hot for him it tasted a little too salty but it was good and the baby really liked it he nearly finished the whole thing. It came in a cute little divided tray with veggies wnd apples. That was cute. \n- I love creme brulée but I did not like the fact that our desserts came out almost right after we ordered them. The sugar on top of the creme brulee was not fresly torched they had been sitting in the refrigerator and was dissapointed because it was not torched right before it came to The table. My husband ordered the Profiteroles those were really good but came three to an order. Fairly large for a dessert but delicious. \n\n*overall a good dinner just wish my steak wasn't chewy and stringy. \n-Also when I go out for a dinner experience I expect a little more of a friendlier service from our server. Which was way off. Our server came to our table said hello. That was it then took our drink order. I work in a restaurant on the strip and every server that touches a table at my job always introduces themselves. Which I look forward too. Our server......I Dont remember his name he did not say his name he didn't care or bother too. I just wish he would've put more effort in his job rather then just taking our order."

  "text" : "I LOVE this restaurant! It is a must-stop for me when I am in Vegas. The location is what truly sells it. I always sit outside where you have an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains while you dine. Perfect for simple wine and appetizers or for a whole meal. They have great heaters cranking in the winter, so you can still comfortably enjoy being on the patio. If there is one thing I would tell everyone to do, it is sit outside and sip a glass of wine. You will not regret it!\n\nWhile the view sells it for me, the food and service are pretty great as well. For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. In the past I've done the French Onion Soup and a side salad, which have been perfect. The Goat Cheese appetizer is warm and satisfying, great to snack on with a glass of wine. \n\nI landed in Vegas 2 nights ago, and my friend's flight was delayed coming in, so I was on my own for dinner. I immediately knew I would go to Mon Ami Gabi. I bundled up in my winter coat and walked over. I asked for a table outside and was very comfortable under one of the many, many heaters they have out there. My server was incredibly helpful with the wine list as my knowledge of French wine is limited, and I loved what he picked for me. You are immediately presented with a loaf of bread and butter, as well as an amuse buche. Tonight is was green apple and fennel with a mayonnaise dressing (the French really do love their mayo). It was a lovely snack while I debated what I wanted. When the waiter came back, I could not make a decision. I mentioned wanting to try the steak tartare as it is something I've somehow never had, and he said that it was his favorite thing on the menu and I must get it. Not wanting to drop $35 and also not being that hungry, he offered to have them make me a half order as an appetizer and charge half the price. Sold!\n\nIt was really delicious, and I am so glad I listened to him. Plus, with the smaller portion and price point, I had room for dessert! Again torn between a few options, I went with his recommendation of the bananas foster crepe. Delicious only begins to explain how good it was. The caramel sauce was decadent and the crepe was light and fluffy. I spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while I ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :). My server would occasionally stop to check on me, often engaging in some lovely conversation and never making me feel like I should hurry up and leave. \n\nA trip to Vegas should always begin with a night on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi!"

Snag a table on the heated patio for great people and Bellagio fountain watching action - as well as an experience that truly makes you feel like you are seated in a nice French bistro.  \n\nOnly things that keep this place from another star is that even though it is part of the Paris hotel - it is somehow independent - so purchases don't count towards your travel rewards.  The chicken sausage - while it may be healthier doesn't taste very good - so avoid that one.

  "text" : "Oooh la la la la la LA!  I've always wanted to come here and yesterday I got to come here with a LOCAL honest-to-goodness Las Vegian: Mon amie, Jenn. \n\nWe sat outside.  Brrrr!  It was allegedly supposed to SNOW later that night. (Il fait neige! See! I speak Fraunsh!) But not to worry- there are heat lamps on the patio to keep you all warm and toasty.  Additionally, the view across the street is the Bellagio and the gorgeous Fountains gave us some \"teaser\" shows.  \n\nJenn had a mimosa and I had a bloody mary.  Apparently there is a bloody mary bar (make your own?!)  but that sounded confusing to me, so I just had them make it for me.  And they did a pretty decent job!  Nothing special- a pretty traditional bloody mary, but it did hit the spot.  \n\nWe both opted for the corned beef hash.  It was really rich and flavorful.  They also provided had the option of adding mushrooms to it, which we both did.  It came with giant toast and potatoes.  I was not disappointed one single bit.  \n\nAdditionally, we both shared some dessert.  The fruit and mint plate, as well as this chocolaty thing with pecans and caramel- creme on top.  Yum.  \n\nThen we wandered around the beautiful Paris for awhile, poking our head into stores and trying on sunglasses and accessories.  \n\nGreat great brunch spot.  Come here!  Sit outside!  J'aime beaucoup!  Bon appetit!"

We had reservations to take our friend out for her birthday, and since it was still in the 100s during the summer, my fiance wore a tank top. There's a clear sign on the door that gentleman are not allowed to wear tank tops and we were crossing our fingers hoping that we wouldn't be kicked out. Luckily the hostess let us know that we could keep our reservation, he would just have to work an oversized tall and long white tee. In my opinion, he looked ridiculous in it and much more inappropriate, but at least we got in and had a good laugh. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here for brunch, whether its Eggs Benedict or French Toast or Croque Madame. I would recommend trying to make reservations through Open Table and eating outside on a nice summer morning."

Staying at Bally's, it was a no brainer to give this place a try.\n\nAnd frankly, I'd come even if I wasn't staying so close. Very good steak + frites - tender, perfectly cooked, and great flavor. The view is hard to beat, as an outside patio seat will get you a perfect view of the Belagio and its fountains. It's even worth doing the patio in the middle of December, as they have heaters that will keep you plenty warm. The people watching is also worth the outside seat.\n\nIf you want a nice dinner without losing an arm, plus want to relax with a view, Mon Ami Gabi is a great place to dine."

I have had many (many, many, many) Vegas trips and pretty much the only thing they all have in common is a meal (or two or three) at  Mon Ami Gabi. I am obsessed with finding the best croque monsieur in the US... which is not easy, but Mon Ami Gabi does a pretty darn good job. The service is always amazing, the patio situated right on the strip is amazing. During the winter it is heated, during the summer it has constant water mist. The wine selection is excellent and the French Onion Soup is the stuff of legends!  \n\nBon appétit."

Even as Las Vegas locals, we had a lot of fun sitting outside watching the fountains. They've also got a really good heating system outside making it comfortable on colder nights.\n\nAs far as food goes...it was okay. I had the steak au poivre which came out overcooked for my taste and pretty dang tough. For whatever reason, the brandy peppercorn sauce was all over half my fries and not the steak so I didn't think the flavor was all that great either. My wife ordered the filet bordelaise which blew mine away. Her steak was tender and topped with just the right amount of onions and a really tasty red wine sauce. We enjoyed the frites too and they give you a huge portion!\n\nThe service was ok but I felt extremely rushed. Our waiter seemed annoyed that our table took a bit of time to decide on what to eat and spend some time chatting after dinner. With drinks and tip, our bill was $400 which may be small to them but doesn't mean we should get subpar service. Maybe it was just a bad night but nothing blew me away and I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."

I don't think that  can really be messed up. For dessert we shared the bread pudding which was Amazing!!! We also shared a bottle of Pino Noir at a very decent price. We ate the night before at Prime for double the price for basically the same quality food and view. I highly recommend this place. I would have given it a 4 to 4 1/2 star but the view was amazing. \n\nAlso you cannot reverse patio seating its first come first serve. Be early because it's very worth it.

The good thing about this was that there is no line at all and you can be seated anywhere you want right away.  I settled with the Patio because that's always the way to go, even during the cold December weather.  And what was cool about the patio was that there were heat lamps all over to the point where the 33 degree weather was a non-factor.  I actually didn't need to wear a jacket outside because the lamps kept the patio pretty hot.\n\nLate dinner on the patio. -- http://bit.ly/1bGgnYZ\nView of Bellagio Fountains from my table. -- http://bit.ly/1bGgDam\n\nOne recurring theme that I was noticing during my last trip to Vegas was that at all the restaurants I went to the appetizers on the menu are actually full meals.  The Duck Leg Confit was on their appetizer section and it was only $11 so I was assuming that it would be a little mini duck leg with some garnish.  Boy was I wrong about that when I got this huge platter presented in front of me with a nice big and crispy duck leg on top of a bed of lentils and port wine reduction.  It was amazing!  I almost decided to cancel out my Beef Bourgninon order because it was already a lot of food!\n\nDuck Leg Confit. This is an appetizer?? Daaaaaaang! -- http://bit.ly/1kBWinH\n\nHad it not been for the Duck Leg Confit \"appetizer\"  I probably could've enjoyed the Beef Bourgninon a lot more, but at the point when it finally reached my table I was already full.  No matter, I pressed on and stuck with it.  The Pappardelle noodles were good and the beef was really tender, plus the bacon and mushrooms gave it even more flavor.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this but it was a really good entree.\n\nClassic Beef Bourguignon --  http://bit.ly/1jRdBnj\n\nSo far every time I've been to Mon Ami Gabi I would order something different and each time has been stellar!  It has proven to me once again that I can come here at any time during the day, whether it be for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and can have amazing food and really good service."

I mean if there were any place in the whole country that you could create a truly \"Paris\" like experience, I would think it would at be the giant multi billion dollar Paris replica in Vegas. This place really feels European, in the sense that you are in a really touristy area of Paris watching Americans and Asians meander by gawking up at the Eiffel Tower and being obnoxious... well ill reserve the obnoxious comment to the Americans. It's not your \"quaint alleyway/place that Hemingway would have hung out\" type of authenticity, but if you're expecting that in Vegas, you are off your rocker anyway - my point is it feels about as authentic as you can get - the food, the decor, the surroundings etc.\n\nThe food is excellent and the service is very friendly (and it's crazy being in a \"European\" place and getting quick service... it feels WRONG!). I would come here again, and recommend to anybody looking for a place on the Strip for dinner/lunch/brunch. As is the case with any popular place in this town... make reservations. My favorite thing about Mon Ami though was the setting/patio and the ambiance. Grab a spot on the patio and this has got to be some of the best people watching in the country. Seriously. Where else can you grab an delicious patio brunch at 11 AM and watch half a dozen drunken bachelor or bachelorette party stumble by during your meal? Got to love Vegas."

Ask to be seated outside as they have a view of the Bellagio water show, and they have heaters so you can sit outside even in the winter.  It's the perfect spot for a couple or friends.  Breakfast or dinner.  It's all doable.  Upside to this is there cheapest item on the menu ($12.95) which the burger is to die for, and so is everything else on the menu.  No complaints from the service or the food.  I definitely recommend."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is situated at the front of the Paris Las Vegas hotel, but the Parisian theme is applied much more subtly inside the dining room than in the rest of the host resort.\n\nWe were seated at a table located at an odd intersection between two dining areas and the kitchen doors which meant a steady stream of servers passing back and forth. This added a fun air of hustle-and-bustle that you might experience in a Parisian Bistro. It was fine at lunch time, but might not be what you want during a romantic date night dinner.\n\nI Started with the Onion Soup au Gratin, which arrived piping hot and topped with a bubbling layer of gratineed cheese. The soup itself was far too sweet and far too gloopy, a symptom of the baguette slices that had been submerged in the dish rather than floated on top of it as is traditional.\n\nMy entree was much better; filet of Pacific Snapper pan-fried in a light herb batter that lent a subtle texture to the fish. The fish sat on top of lobster cream and butternut squash orzo pasta, which was light and flavorful. \n\nThere was a broad selection of French wines available, plus a limited, but high quality selection of beers.\n\nI would eat at Mon Ami Gabi again."

  "text" : "Food: Delicious! Definitely get one of the steak frites. My boyfriend got the fish & chips, and they weren't as amazing as what the rest of the family got. I personally loved my steak au poivre, my boyfriend's brother loved his steak bordelaise, and my boyfriend's dad got the ribeye. The portions and quality of food are worth the price. Definitely try one of the desserts - the warm chocolate cake was fabulous.\n\nService: The service was good, but if you need to be on time for a show (like the O at the Bellagio across the street), make sure to tell your server ASAP! I told the hostess as she walked us to the door, but I really should have also spoken with the server immediately. She took her time at first before we spoke to her about our tickets, but after that was absolutely perfect, getting the food out to us quickly, etc. Our water glasses were always full, and we got everything we wanted.\n\nLocation/Seating: We got a perfect table right at the edge of the patio. Unless it's super cold, definitely sit on the patio. There are heat lamps, you can people-watch, and you have front-row seating for the Bellagio fountain show.\n\nGETTING A TABLE:\nOkay, here's the info I really need you to know: Just try everything. Try to get a reservation (indoors only), then show up 45-60 minutes before you actually want to eat and ask for an outdoor patio seat. You can also ask for an indoors table, but the ambiance wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a fancy restaurant.\n\nThe reason why this place is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their ridiculous approach to tables. I wanted to eat at 5:30 to get to our 7:30 show at the Bellagio. No reservations except for 4:30 and 9:30 - I went with neither. So my boyfriend and I showed up an hour early and went to separate lines (???) for an indoor table vs. an outdoor table. He could get an outdoor table that could be ready around 5:30 (perfect) and I couldn't get anything until 9. I just got mad when we were escorted to our patio table and we passed by several empty tables that could have accommodated our party. That was frustrating and I could see how that wouldn't be great if the weather was terrible (unlikely) or if someone really needed to sit inside. I dunno, that just didn't make any sense."

It would have been nice for them to split it like they do in Chicago.  Everything was great, but the service was a step down from the service that you would normally get at the original.  We were still very happy with our meal, but I guess Vegas servers are just a step down from what you get in the Windy City."

  "text" : "UPFRONT DISCLAIMER: I'm not a fan of Las Vegas. Don't like the Oz-like fantasy world and the wretched excess of blatant consumerism that is thrust in your face from every angle. And I'm tired of holding my breath so as not to catch a case of cancer from all the cigarettes as I try to take a shortcut through some casino to get to the street! So I'm kinda prejudiced against just about anything in that town save the Bellagio fountains (how can you not get a kick out of that??!!) \n\nWhich brings up restaurants. More celeb restaurants per square foot here than anywhere else in the world and, quite frankly, it's all overkill. Most are factories with a big name attached. And yes, the food at these places can be decent. I just find them to be over-priced splurges for the masses who come here once a year on a big vacation!\n\nBut then there's Mon Ami Gabi. The only big name attached here is the Lettuce Entertain You folks out of Chicago who happen to run some pretty popular and very accessible restaurants from Chi-Town to Santa Monica. What they've done here at Paris, Paris is create a very friendly French Bistro & Terrace environment with pretty authentic French Bistro fare at a reasonable price -- all staged across the street from those killer fountains of Bellagio! This is not Alain Ducasse cuisine by ay stretch of the imagination but the recipes and preparations have integrity, the service is delivered with friendly attitude and the setting is cool.  Intimate it is not but you can find your own intimacy within the bustle and flow of the dining scene here. It's alive, glowing, engaging and delicious! We've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner over several different trips and have always found it to be a good value, delicious and a pleasant escape from the frenetic antics of the Vegas denizens.\n\nI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi! C'est si bon!"

I think something they could do about the half plate of fries was to add something else like seasoned vegetables, some sort of salad, or just a smaller portion of fries. It was great, but I couldn't finish it all! I ordered a Steak Dijon and it was good, but they could have been a bitttt more generous with the sauce. My brother's Steak Merlot was ok given that he ordered it medium well. (not a big fan of anything more than medium) My dad's filet mignon...MMMMMMMMMMM...YUMMY! He doesn't like bloody stuff, so it was well done and still!!! I'd think it'd be difficult to order a tasty well done filet mignon, but this chef did it! Meat was not burnt, hard, or super chewy. Nice and tender. Delicious!!! I've got nothing but compliments for their food. My mom had the Trout Amandine. I expected it to be so-so, but goodness! It was practically boneless and the fish was sooooooo soft. It felt like it just melted in my mouth. I ordered a banana crepe afterward and it was okay! It wasn't amazing, but everything else for the night was just wonderful. Definitely coming back again! :)"

That was the best duck confit I've ever had in the U.S. The meat would just fall off the bone. My hubby had the chicken paillard & the macaroni gratin which he said were very good. The waitress recommended a white chocolate bread pudding. It was served warm with ice cream.. Very good too. \n\nThis place has great food, great service, nice atmosphere and a reasonable price.

  "text" : "My wife, daughter and son-in-law recently made a road trip to Las Vegas from their home in Palo Alto. Our lunch here was perhaps my best meal there, and it was also surprisingly affordable, at least by the standards of the Vegas strip. The location is also great.\n\nI had the steak frites classique, which was superb, and well worth the 20-some dollars I paid for it. The steak was perfectly prepared (I ordered it medium rare), and was accompanied by a large mound of interesting and tasty french fries, fresh cut into ribbon shapes. (See my daughter Adrienne M's review for photos.) I am informed that the fries taste very good cold the next day, like good potato chips. My wife had the lobster roll, which was her second choice (she had asked for the trout almondine, but was told after she ordered it that the trout had not made it to the restaurant yet that day). She was, however, very satisfied with her lobster roll, and was particularly pleased that it was served on a Maine-style bun. My SIL enjoyed his steak sandwich. My daughter wasn't wild about her chicken/brie/apple sandwich; she thought it had a sour taste. The bite she gave me did have a bit of a sour taste to it (probably from the apples), but I didn't mind it at all, although being a true carnivore I preferred my steak. \n\nThe meal was preceded by a fabulous crusty baguette, served with butter. This didn't last long with the four of us, but a request for a second was cheerfully and promptly satisfied (no extra charge).\n\nService was also very good, prompt and courteous at all times.\n\nHighly recommended for an excellent and reasonably priced meal in a town where these two descriptions often contradict one another."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi was so good for lunch, we went back for breakfast. I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time. You can't sit on the patio which is only first come first served, but we got a table just inside the patio so we had a similar view and I couldn't see it being worth the several hour wait others went through to sit on the patio. Getting seated immediately was much nicer.\n\nThe service is a tad bit slow, but if you go knowing that, it won't bother you much. Plus, it's a restaurant attempting to recreate a Parisian dining experience, which is much slower than the meals we're used to as Americans. This restaurant works like a well-oiled machine and food was consistently great with interesting specials offered.\n\nThe reason we chose this restaurant was because I can't eat gluten and this restaurant was rated as safe by people with Celiac disease so I trusted this restaurant to prepare me a good quality meal that wouldn't make me sick and they delivered twice. For lunch I had a burger on a gluten free bun which was delicious and cooked perfectly with Bleu cheese on top. The thin fries they serve were also great and we were assured everything was prepared in a separate section of the kitchen to avoid cross-contamination. The staff made me feel very safe eating there which is very rare. My meal even came with an allergy stick in it and the person that delivered it stated it was gluten free as well. Having all the staff on the same page and having these quality control pieces in place is the best way to cater to allergies in a restaurant. Also had the creme brulee which is well worth over-stuffing yourself.\n\nFor breakfast I had gluten free French toast with a blueberry sauce and fresh whipped cream. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, even when I used to be able to eat normally. My bf had the skinny pancake (crepe) special with cinnamon and Nutella and hazelnuts. The waiter apologized for not being able to make gluten free crepes or waffles but that was fine with me and expected, although I would say it isn't hard to find a good waffle and crepe gluten free recipe if Mon Ami Gabi wanted to send their gluten free customers to heaven. \n\nAll and all, great atmosphere, a relaxing meal, and outdid my expectations and I didn't get sick. Totally awesome. Merci, Gabi!"

A few tips:\n\n - Make a reservation as it gets packed pretty quickly\n - Don't sit outside on the patio unless the weather is nice or you don't mind eating with your jacket on. The heat lamps are not very warm (we quickly got up and moved inside)\n - The cafe area adjacent to the patio is probably the best area for brunch. Very light and sunny, but sheltered from the cold/wind.\n - If you drive there, plan to arrive early as you have to walk all the way through the shopping area and casino to get to the restaurant.\n\nFor brunch, I've had the brioche french toast and the corned beef hash. French toast wins hands down unless you want something savory. The smoked salmon platter is fairly generous and the benedicts all looked very good.\n\nService was good and prompt. I had my coffee refilled several times without asking. Note they add gratuity for parties of 5 or more."

It tasted like it says - tuna melt, so you taste tuna salad with lots of different veggies and toppings on top of the crusty bread.  Bellpeppers, onions, artichokes...it was good.  It also came with a little salad on the side, which was nice.\n\nAll of the hot sandwiches (which this is) come with french fries on the side.  They are very interesting and you can tell they make it there.  They are flat and thin, some are more crispy and some are more soggy but they were good and a nice addition to the sandwich.  \n\nSALMON SALAD - My sister got this and said it was good, it came with a good amount of salmon and the entire entree was definitely plenty for lunch portions.  My mom accidentally got the \"mixed greens\" which was a small plate and she added salmon to it, but my sister's salad looked much better.\n\nOverall - I'd suggest making reservations for lunch for a light but great lunch where you feel like you're in paris on the street at a cafe."

  "text" : "Have you been to Paris, France? If you haven't this is the best as it gets to eating in Paris, France. Eating here for the first time reminded my family and I of eating in Champs Elysees. Everything on the menu reminds you of France. My favorite dish, being the beef tartare. (raw beef). Although a bit different from the French Version. The French version the tartare is soaked in worsestershire sauce and an a raw egg on top, which you mix in later. Though the Las Vegas Version was quite edible. Needs more bread though for the tartare. The frites (fries) were quite good, although the frites in France were like big potato skins like thick and huge. The fish (skate) that my brother had ordered was pretty tasty. The one dish that caught our attention the most was the french onion soup. It was served just right. Since we weren't driving that day, it was perfect to drink some Frangria. (mixed wine with fruits). How much better can it get? It does get better, since we were sitting outside with a view of the fountains of bellagio. So, every 15 minutes, we had a fountain show of the bellagio! Sitting outside with such a view earned this rating the 2 stars. Try to arrive early, as it gets really busy! This is one for the books."

I've always wanted to but just never had the chance to! And I cannot believe on what I was missing out on! Let's start by the staff being super friendly! And of course the location, dead center of the strip across the bellagio fountains in the Paris hotel! Cocktails were on point! My favorite was the Parisian Romance! Next we're the AMAZING appetizers! The escargot that was covered in garlic has to be my favorite! We also had the mussels and the duck which was just as yummy! I had the mushroom soup and it is the BEST! I can't forget the warm and toasty bread they serve you with butter and carrot musse! Then came the desserts...we had creme brûlée and the white chocolate bread pudding which was so heavenly to the last bite! I look forward to coming back here again and again and will make sure I try everything on their menu! So glad to know that they have one in Chicago! Hopefully they are just as good as the one here in Vegas! Prices were very reasonable and worth it! Definitely will be back and hope you will enjoy it just as much as I do! Bon appetit!"

Since my plans for the day concluded earlier than planned, I arrived at Mon Ami sooner as well and JUST managed to nab the one remaining patio table.\n\nWhat else is there to say beyond what has already been waxed lyrical about Mon Ami? Not much really. The service there was excellent, the food was top notch (French onion soup, ribeye steak frites done medium, a glass of Gigondas, finishing with creme brulee), and the view was fantastic. Loved every minute of my meal there, and I would strongly recommend Mon Ami to anyone considering a beautiful dining experience on the Strip."

Bone-in rib eye with Bearnaise - now THAT is what steak should taste like. It came out more medium rare than medium, which is fine by me. Perfectly seasoned and wonderfully flavorful. The sauce was rich and delicious as well.\n\nFor sides we went with the garlic spinach, which was honestly just kind of \"m'eh\", but the pureed cauliflower was awesome.  \n\nNo room for dessert, though I'm sure it would have been great. \n\nDefinitely a place to hit up in Vegas - Mon Ami Gabi has great ambiance, service and really reasonable (by Vegas standards) prices.

The patio seats are highly coveted since they are great for people watching, but terrible for sun burns and flies.  Located on the strip at Paris, across from the Bellagio fountains, this restaurant features a fancy decor inside/more lax on the patio, moderately priced items, and delicious food. \n\n-chicken and brie sandwich: with caramelized onions and green apple slices, came with their flat salty fries and a mini salad, this sandwich was very very good. Not heavy at all. The combination was divine. \n-grilled cheese duck confit: also came with their flat salty fries, mini salad, a berry/ginger fruit compote. This was very heavy and greasy. The sweet compote is a must add to the salty duck. Overall good, but definitely share this dish as a whole sandwich would be too much, unless of course you plan on just lazying around for an hour or two after. \n-free birthday dessert: puff roll with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream inside, drizzled with chocolate sauce. good. can't complain about free. \n-marquis de la tour champagne: light, bubbly, fun. \n\nI'd come back for the breakfast and their french onion soup, just to see what all the fuss is about.

  "text" : "We made a reservation... So trying to check in was frustrating because thy have three different hostess stands, and the hostesses were super rude. I finally find the right one and then I have to wait 20 mins for my reservation. When we finally are about to get seated the hostess offers us a able outside, then the hostess next to her tells her not to offer it to me (seriously). So she apologizes and says I can't have it. Ok?! A guy walks up right behind me with his buzzer and offers him the table outside. Did that just happen?! Oh wait, it did....Possibly the worst first impression of any restaurant I've been to. If my best friend wasn't so excite to eat here I for sure would have walked off.\n\nLets get to the food. I ordered the special. It was medallions wrapped with bacon. And to be fair the waitress said you could not request how you like the steak due to bacon having to be cooked a certain temperature.... My medallions were so over cooked they were like hard little poker chips... And were as chewy a beef jerky. Possibly the worst steak I've ever had. They were a dark brown color the ENTIRE way through. Gross.\n\nThe only good thing that happened during the entire meal was our server. #74. She was awesome! \n\nI considered ordering something other than steak, but since this place seems to be known for steaks I decided to go with it. And since I was ordering a steak I wanted one of the better cuts. If you are looking for $200 beef jerky and to be treated like crap upon check in you should make a \"reservation\" for this place. Complete disappointment. Vegas has some amazing restaurants don't waste your time and money on this one."

The best part is I ordered wine by the glass and it was very good and reasonable ( $9)\nThe waiter was very pleasant and the food come out quickly\nThe only down was after we where seated it took a while for our waiter to show up about 15 minutes but we did not mind we where seated outside and the water fountain show at the Bellaggio is excellent to watch ,we also were able to enjoy a street performer about 30 feet away on sidewalk.\nTotal bill for 4 was 175.00"

This restaurant is located across from the Eiffel Tower ride in the casino and along the Vegas Strip where you can watch the Bellagio fountains from the outdoor patio. Everything here was exquisite, from the staff, restaurant decor and of course the French FOOD!\n\nI came here on a variety of occasions; wedding receptions, birthdays, family and friends. Every time I dine at Mon Ami Gabi, it always works out to perfection and it's hard to fault on anything except for the wait, but that's minor. \n\nSome of the items I've ordered in Mon Ami Gabi:\n\n+Oysters  Du Jour - $15.95\n+Wild Escargots De Bourgogne - $13.95\n+Onion Soup Au Gratin - $9.95\n+Caesar Salad - $11.95\n+Filet Mignon - $35.95\n+Au Poivre Burger - $13.95\n\nEverything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way. If any of my friends of family were visiting Las Vegas for the first time, than Mon Ami Gabi would be on my, \"Must Do List!\" Especially the patio seating because it offers some of the best views of the center strip and it can be hard to get a table there. \n\nTip: Book a table in advance!\n\nBon Appetite!!"

Got the mushroom, chicken, and brie crepe as well as the mussels to share. The half portion of mussels was actually very large with a lot of mussels for only $11.95. Also sampled my friend's butternut squash quiche which was yummy as well. The french onion soup had a very strong onion flavor and was loaded with cheese on top so that is a good item to order if you like french onion soup. Their fries are good too - kind of flat but wavy. My other friends ordered the seafood crepe which looked great as well with large pieces of succulent shrimp. Other girls had the steak which is the same cut but comes covered with different sauces depending on what you feel like. Didn't get to try a bloody mary but they had this awesome bloody mary bar where you can deck out your drink with whatever you please!"

Anyway we ordered the French onion soup and the beef hash with poached eggs.\n\nThe soup was too salty, we received 2 pieces of potatoes with the eggs, and the eggs were a little overcooked.

The salad was very refreshing and the ahi tuna was perfect! My brother had the ahi tuna burger and practically inhaled it he liked it so much. Then for dessert he got the white chocolate bread pudding and he loved that, while I got the lemon-lime sorbet. \nThe service was great as well.

  "text" : "I am a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi. I used to go the Chicago location quite often and miss it a lot. This was my first time trying the Vegas one and I LOVED it! Our server was actually French (Canadian) and had a lovely accent, which contributed to the positive experience. Although, I am disappointed that they couldn't do a Picon Beer. This is a beer & liquor combination that you find all over France. Anyway, I can't say enough good things about this place. Hands down, best patio in Vegas for dining. You get an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, which seem to go off every 15 min or so. The lights of the Paris Hotel & Casino are also a sight to be seen whether you are looking at their balloon sign or at the Eiffel Tower. \n\nThe menu is moderately priced for anywhere, let alone, the Vegas Strip. I had the steak frites with Bearnaise sauce. So yummy! Yes, it's a thin piece of steak, but it's a large piece of steak and was perfectly cooked. I also tried the pate' as a starter. It was tasty, but not the best I've had. I love the fresh warm baguettes they bring to your table along with the complimentary carrot salad. The meal was such a wonderful experience, but the drinks were inconsistent. I had a side car that was almost all orange liquor and very sweet, but one of my friends ordered a couple of the same drink and they were both stronger and not as sweet. Not sure what was going on with that. \n\nThe vibe is casual, but you can also dress up if you like. The patio is warm enough even on colder nights because of the heat lamps. The only thing that took me out of it, was the guys flicking those porn cards on the sidewalk in front of us. There were all kinds of shady characters hovering around, so ladies definitely don't leave your purses close to the railing. \n\nThe decor was very French bistro and looked so similar to the Chicago location. It's just a lot bigger and not in a historic building. They even have the wine carts! I give this place four stars for the food and service. I didn't give them a perfect five because of the drink issues. Every nice restaurant should know how to make a classic drink like a side car, especially if I'm paying $12 or more for it. \n\nI will definitely return. The prices match my budget and I love the menu. Can't beat the view either! Gabi, you are definitely Mon Ami!"

I specifically asked for a medium rare burger and what I got, of course, was a well done burger with literally a paper thin slice of cheese.  It was $13 and did come with their fantastic fries.  The burger was not made on the premises and was in fact pre-formed.  That's ridiculous.\n\nI waited at least 15 minutes for the replacement.  There was no offer to take it off the bill..I took it off the bill myself.  Horrible on-site floor managers.  They could care less about your dining experience.  I wrote to the corporate offices of Lettuce Entertain You.  They never wrote back.\n\nBeautiful looking restaurant.  Good luck and I hope you have a better dining experience than I had.

The beef wellington and skate wing didn't suit my taste. I'm not a fan of the texture of skate wing and discovered I hate capers after trying this dish.

You also get a small cachepot of fresh radish slaw. Magnifique! \n\nThere is indoor and outdoor seating - the further indoor you go towards Paris casino, the darker it gets. I sat in the middle area - not outdoors on the strip and not indoors towards the cave-like setting. It was perfect!\n\nI split the half roasted chicken with pommes frites and a side salad. These are no ordinary French fries: thinly sliced and fried to perfection, they are highly addictive! Dinner for two (splitting a salad and main dish) without wine came to around $35 or so. Not bad for Vegas!\n\nOur waitress was pleasant enough, but not overly personable. That has been my experience with Vegas, it's such a touristy town that the customer service seems pretty impersonal but still gets the job done. Most likely the couple you serve tonight will not be around to come back again next month unlike establishments in your local 'hood."

They were willing to allow us to have an extra join when that person arrived earlier than expected, and were more than happy to hurry his food to help us make a show.\n\nThe food itself was delicious, the portion a great lunch size, not too big but enough to fill you and allow you to keep on going until dinner.

Drew, their group event planner, was very helpful with the reservation process, willingly changing our reservation time and at the last minute, changing it from a large party (12 people) to only 4 people for lunch.\n\nHowever the food was ok for the price and ambiance. We were seated at a table next to another 2 top table literally inches away from us (\"rubbing elbows\" is an understatement.\" The servers were nice, attentive and well informed of the specials. I went with the lobster roll, which was stuffed with lobster but was too creamy for my taste (I favor traditional New England lobster rolls that highlight the lobster with basic butter.) My chips started out crispy but were bland and tough to chew by meals end. I liked the idea of my boyfriends open faced tuna melt sandwich, but preferred eating his fries which were crispy and seasoned well. My girlfriend got the seafood crepe, and she said the scallops were cooked to perfection, but very pricey ($19) for what you got. Her husband scarfed down his corned beef hash and eggs, but the portion was so small, he finished my lobster roll for me.\n\nI might have given another star if we were sat on the patio but it was a 45 minute wait!

VERY buttery and herb filled. Escargot tasted great and seasoned perfectly. The garlic herb butter was DELICIOUS and went extremely well with the complimentary bread that was served. Before i knew it, i was cleaning the escargot tray with the bread, not a drop of garlic herb butter was left ! mmm ! yummy ! \n\nBearnaise Steak Frites w/ classic bearnaise sauce - Thin cut of steak with a mountain (not exagerating, there was a seemingly endless amount) of hand-cut fries. As for the steak, i had ordered medium rare. Come out a little more towards medium to medium well. Didn't really give it too much thought. The cut was quite thin. To get it seared on each side and edges, already puts it quite cooked. The bearnaise sauce was pretty good. Creamy, slighty sour, bright flavored sauce. Matched the steak pretty well.

The staff were very friendly despite our being obvious tourists, our server went on at length about the wine and she made sure we got just the right wine to go with our meal- she really knew her stuff! Service was very fast despite the place being packed, and the food was wonderful. The server was right on target with her wine suggestions, they were perfect with our seafood. The fresh bread and butter with the meal were a nice treat as well. They also found the perfect romantic spot for us to sit- a candle lit table for two indoors (it was rather chilly outside) with a clear view of the fountains of Bellagio across the street. Our quick stop to eat turned into a romantic candle-lit dinner, what a nice way to end our vacation. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 was because it was rather pricey- our food, one glass of wine each and the tip came to $90. But  funny enough, I had just won $90 playing blackjack in the Mirage so I guess it was meant to be!"

  "text" : "My review is based solely on brunch. I would have to say, if I was to return, I would return for dinner, not brunch. IMO the food is way too heavy for morning or even mid-day. My hubby and I had the french onion soup as recommended by many reviewers on yelp. I found it too cheesy. . . and I am a person that likes cheese. My hubby got corn beef hash which he seemed pretty \"meh\" about. Not bad, not good. I ordered a tuna melt. It came open faced, with a thick slice of cheese melted on top. The tuna was mixed heavily with olives and olive juice. My first bite was so salty I could feel my face swelling up already. I decided to preserve both the sandwich and the fries for the homeless man sitting outside the restaurant. My appetite for food had vanished and I proceeded to order cocktails. Cocktails were good. Service was great. Ambiance is what gave my review two stars."

Who knew that it rained in Vegas?\n\nBreakfast, Breakfast, Breakfast.  This is what you do here.  They have an amazing breakfast.  French-inspired.  Get the Eggs Benedict.  I go au naturale and get the style with the Canadian ham, but one trip they had it with smoked salmon.  I am not sure if this is a permanent item, but it was damn good.  Also, grab a Blood Mary.  \n\nImagine snacking on perfectly poached eggs resting on top of grilled Canadian ham and piggy-backing on an English muffin.  Now imagine the Bellagio Fountains go off as you take a sip of your Bloody Mary.  \n\nLunch and Dinner are great too and you will see more fountain action during this time, but it may be difficult to get a table outside.  Also, you will have to tolerate the transformers, batman, porn slappers, and other craziness on the strip.....because you are right there in the thick of it.\n\nI say you reserve this as a place for breakfast.

  "text" : "The wife and I were invited to join another couple for Sunday brunch at Mon Ami Gabi.  It was late morning on a beautiful, clear, sunny January day.  It was so nice on this particular day; we knew it would be a shame to not eat outside on Mon Ami Gabi's patio overlooking the Strip across from the Bellagio.  We didn't have reservations, not that it would've helped, since outside dining was first come, first served.  As luck would have it, a table was available immediately for our party and we were treated to a four top up against the rail with an unobstructed Strip-side view of passersby.  Needless to say, it's one of the best people watching spots on the Strip.  \n\nWe started off by sharing orders of the Housemade Country Pate ($10.95) and the trio of artisan cheeses ($15.95).  The portion of pate was surprisingly generous and a great starter.  The cheeses, while delicious, were nothing terribly special or unique and probably a bit overpriced compared to the seeming value of the pate and what we received for the rest of our meal.  The wife and I split orders of the Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich ($12.95) and the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche ($13.95).  The grilled chicken and brie was topped with caramelized onions and thin slices of green apple.  It was a nice-looking and tasting sandwich and an overall winner.  The quiche was tasty, as well, possessing a nice and buttery, flaky crust.  The amount of food was plentiful for the price.   \n\nFor a national chain restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi impressed me enough to want to check out its location much closer to our home in Northern Virginia.  Mon Ami Gabi served up a solid meal made all the more special by its singular al fresco dining experience.  If you go, go on a good weather day, and sit outside!"

  "text" : "I'll start by saying that I'm the kind of person that likes variety, but this place was so good and well-priced that I found myself there on two consecutive nights recently.  First of all, you can request to sit in their large windowed room or on their patio in order to view the spectacle that is the Bellagio water show.  At night the show is very beautiful, and contrasts well with the soft candelight and ambiance of the dining room.\n\nConcerning the food, I started with the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer.  Everyone at my table thought this was beyond good.  They serve it with a crispy garlic bread, and the portion is rather large so you'll want to share with a few other people if you can.  For my main dish I chose the pan seared scallops, which were perfectly cooked and tender with a sweet puree sauce.  I also made sure to try my friend's filet mignon with merlot butter sauce and it was DELICIOUS.  It came out to be about two inches thick, and really was a beautiful piece of meat which was well complemented by the crispy texture of the pommes frites.  If you try combining the scallops with the filet into a surf-and-turf kind of heaven, you won't be disappointed.\n\nFor dessert we tried several of their varieties.  By far the best was the white chocolate bread pudding.  It was rich and delicious, without the gummy texture that some poorly cooked bread pudding tends to take on.  I specifically ordered the lemon tart, which was combined with some sour cherry concoction and was truly delicious.  If you like your dessert a bit tart, I would definitely recommend this.  The chocolate flourless cake was really good too, and came with a delicious ice cream.  \n\nMy only complaint, which is probably a matter of personal preference, is that I found the french onion soup just okay.  It was a bit too sweet for me, and I would have liked the bread to retain some of it's crunch.  Other than that, everything else was delicious!"

It is a must that you define al fresco here.\nMy friends took me here for my birthday, and it did not disappoint.\nThe bread was placed on our table in a bag, similar to a baguette bag. It was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The butter was sweet and spreadable and creamy, that had to be handmade on site. It was so good.\nWe started off with a full carafe of frangria, their twist on sangria, which was a wonderful  blend of fruit and alcohol. Not too sweet, but not overpowered by alcohol.\nFor starters we had the duck leg confit, this was the star of the meal. It came with sweet onions and lentils. Fall off the bone tender.\nEntrees, 2 of us had the scallops, one had steak frites and the other had the roasted chicken.\nThe scallops, 4 large, were served with a side of sauteed mushrooms on a bed of sweet potato puree. Absolutely delicious, I couldnt finish mine. The scallops were perfectly tender and flavorful.\nThe steak was a perfect medium rare and my friend asked for green beans instead of fries, which they were fine with. According to her, the meal was one of the best she has ever had.\nMy other friend had the chicken, which was served with garlic mashed potatoes. Here too, the chicked was succulent and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were amazing.\nFor desert we had coffee and shared the pecan chocolate bar with a dollop of creme fraiche. It tasted like a fancy turtle. So delicious. The crust was this perfect biscuit/wafer.\nMon Ami Gabi is located right across from the Bellagio, which has a fountain show every night. So stunningly beautiful.\nOur waitress Sarah was very attentive and she never hovered. She took a few snaps for us with the fountain show as background.\nOverall the best dining experience ever!"

The last time I went was last weekend and it was very good. A friend and I went for breakfast but once I got there I was really craving a burger...so I got a cheeseburger with brie and an over medium egg...that counts as breakfast, right? (Now I'm kind of kicking myself because reading my last review, they had the same special for benedict...ooooph). The coffee continues to be good, they use Intelligentsia, so it is consistent with other tasty coffee places. Let me say that the burger was super delicious and large (and i totally ate the whole thing....yum), BUT it was not cooked correctly...ordered medium, served well done. I didn't really mind, but to be technical, it was incorrect. The egg was cooked correctly. The whole thing was really very tasty. The frites that came with it were not so awesome... a little too thin, they were kind of the texture of pork rinds. Regardless, for 15$ I would certainly get it again.... I will be back."

Each steak come with the most delicious tiny little French fries (frites) and you will eat every last bite of them. The last two times we were there (my birthday and valentines day) we had the same server, Demetri, and he clearly loves his job! We never feel like we are a burden on the wait staff, they enjoy working at their restaurant just as much as we do dining there. My one and only complaint is that the valet at Paris is usually full and if you have to park in the garage you need to give yourself 10 extra minutes to get to your reservation on time.

Brunch here is not bad, there's an outdoor patio to enjoy some sunlight and the inside looks rather fancy - for brunch, but i am not complaining. We were seated quickly but then again we came at 1 ish. Servers were really nice. The place smelled amazing. Everyone's dishes looked so appetizing. I split a mushroom omelette - big mistake, the portions here are not as big as Hash House lol so definitely coulda finished this on my own. The mushroom omelette was pretty good. Usually not a fan of mushroom but it went well with the chives and cheese. My friend ordered the chicken brie and apple crepe - which was also pretty good. I love chicken and it wasn't dry. Next time that's probably what I'm going to order. Actually, I really wanna try this \"melt in your mouth\" steak my friend has been raving about.

  "text" : "I really, really love this place--it seems like I come here for brunch every time I'm in Vegas. The make-your-own-Bloody Mary bar is a highlight when it's offered, but otherwise the cocktail list is very good, and the food is delicious. I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy.\n\nThe only issue I've ever encountered here is that it can be very crowded and very busy; there are occasional moments where it is difficult to flag down your server (thus my star deduction)--in particular, the server mutilated the split check we requested, charging me a couple of pennies while my friend was charged the balance, and it took nearly five minutes to get his attention after we discovered the error (he promptly fixed it, though, and was extremely apologetic).\n\nAn important note: Reservations are not possible if you want to eat on the outdoor terrace patio thing--you just have to stand in line and wait. However, I feel like the patio is overrated, since it can be quite hot and you'll be just inches away from drunk people who are smoking/screaming/doing whatever. Really--truly--eating outside on the Las Vegas Strip is not worth the wait or the grief. Believe me. Don't be a noob. Do yourself a huge favor and just eat inside where there is sweet, sweet air conditioning--you can make yourself a reservation online on OpenTable.com and bypass the line."

My friend enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, which we read they were known for.\n\nI don't even know what to say about the delicious chocolate mousse.

We started with the mussels - so delicious!  I'm a sucker for mussels in wine and butter sauce, especially when we have bread to dip in the sauce!  My mother had the hanger steak which was perfect in a semi-sweet glaze.  I had the filet mignon in merlot sauce which was amazing!  Every bite melted in my mouth like a perfectly cooked medium-well steak should.  Our server suggested the Beaujolais wine to pair with my steak - and it was indeed a perfect match!  I've never had fries with steak, but the frites that the steaks came with were equally delicious.  \n\nI'm so glad this place exists, and will definitely be coming back!

From the outside seating you can get a perfect view of the strip and Bellagio's fountain show. However, the food was quite disappointing. What stood out was their smoked salmon and water. Yes, I said water. Which means the other food really isn't that good.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the French onion soup. He said there was waaay too much cheese and not enough onions. The broth was not beefy enough. My other friend ordered the steak burger and the meat also lacked flavor. The Dijon mustard they gave didn't even taste like Dijon. I ordered the chicken & mushroom crepes and I too was disappointed. The chicken was soooooo dry! I'm surprised because isn't French food supposed to be packed with flavors? Here everything is lacking!\n\nThe 2 dishes that I did like was the smoked salmon appetizer and the smoked salmon & egg tartine salad. Surprisingly, I am normally not a big fan of smoke salmon but it was quite good here. Fresh & light! Finally, something right. Oh yeah, and the water was good.

We didn't have reservations as I wanted to sit in the outdoor patio, which is served on a first come basis. We were told the wait would be roughly an hour, and were surprised to be seated after 20 or so minutes.\n\nIf you're planning to sit outdoors, be prepared for very tight and cramped seating. The patio is a popular choice and it's like the restaurant wanted to maximize the space and squeeze as many tables in there as possible. But the view of the Bellagio fountains slightly makes it all worth it. One extra star for the view.\n\nI started off with their St. Germaine cocktail ($15), which was light, sweet and refreshing, and Onion Soup Gratin ($11), which was baked with Gruyere cheese. It was heavy and very flavorful, but I couldn't finish it since it was too salty. While my Eggs Benedict ($15) consisted of Canadian bacon, it was very standard and unmemorable. The rest of my party had the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad ($20) and Maine Lobster Roll ($18), which seemed to be fairly mediocre as well.\n\nThe service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly and outgoing, but couldn't be found half the time. Maybe it was because it was busy, but we seemed to wait forever for everything, even small requests.\n\nNot too sure if I'd come back, unless I'm in the mood for a bougie al fresco lunch with Bellagio fountain music playing in the background every 15-minutes. If you want decent food for the same price, you're better off at Grand Lux Café. If you want better food with a view and aren't on a budget, go to one of Bellagio's lakefront restaurants.\n\nP.S.

  "text" : "Went here last night to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. The restaurant is neatly tucked underneath the Eiffel Tower of the Paris hotel. Scheduled our reservation through OpenTable, and after arriving we were seated within minutes. The place was packed, but I was very happy with our spot. \n\nTo start off we were given a plate of carrot salad, and bread on the side. My lady hates carrots, but she thought it tasted great. The bread was good, although I was surprised it wasn't pre cut. Never tried escargot before, but we had to try! It was warm, tasty, and had a texture similar to scallops. We gobbled it up like candy. For the main course I ordered a Steak Bordelaise cooked medium rare. The steak was thin, and so tender my heart melted with every bite. The caramelized onion sauce was the perfect topping. My girlfriend's should've been the same, yet it was overcooked. The frites were ok but the whipped cauliflower had us licking the bowl.  We received a complimentary desert for her birthday. \n\nThe restaurant has an intimate setting, so it may be hard to spot your waiter at times. Our waiter's service started off great, but declined over time. He checked on us less often, and was in a constant rush.  After we finished, I did the usual signing of the receipt since I paid with my card. The waiter immediately scooped it off the table while we were still talking. Definitely an awkward moment.\n\nIf you're in the mood for french cuisine, check this place out. I have a feeling it may not be the best, but the prices are reasonable and the food is fantastic."

Sit out on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain show rather than sitting indoors (which is pretty dim). If you are here before 11AM, the fountain show is only once or twice an hour, so be warned.\n\nThey have juicy mimosas and bloody marys accented nicely with particularly fresh celeries, but their bloody marys look watery rather than the thick consistency you would expect from the tomato liquor. Anyhow, sweet and salty cravings can be satisfied here with their perfectly done eggs any way you like them (omelettes, poached, eggs benedict--yum!) or delectable french toast. The french toast...it is a beauty, crunchy outside and stretchy/fluffy inside with blueberries dancing atop. The blueberry syrup is not syrup at all, but a puree. Make sure the bite you take with your fork has a good proportion of toast, powdered sugar, whipped cream, blueberries, and blueberry syrup."

It's cooked perfectly every time, the sauce is amazing, and it comes with a side of \"you think there's a lot, but somehow you're gonna put them all away\" pommes frite.  And while you wait for your amazing piece of beef, you can enjoy delicious French bread, some nice wine, the Bellagio fountain view, and hopefully you will be wise enough to order the French Onion Soup as well.  \n\nI don't know what took me so long to write this review, but after coming back this past weekend, I knew it was time.  \n\nI probably should have written it 3 years ago when we had our wedding dinner here for 70 guests and it was flawless.  Every single entree came out perfectly, the servers didn't miss a beat, and everyone truly enjoyed themselves.  To quote one of my guests, \"This steak is so good, I would snort it if I could.\"  \n\nThe planning process for our wedding event was also handled fantastically by the coordinators and they were so accommodating to the OCD, nutty bride that I had briefly become.\n\nP.s. It's good for breakfast and lunch too!"

  "text" : "What an adorable place for a lunch or brunch! If your timing is good or if you're willing to wait, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal. Unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when I was there. \n\nMy family and I stopped by for a Sunday lunch/brunch. Their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. That morning, the warm chicken and brie sandwich was calling my name and I had to answer. I loved my sandwich! It was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. I think I may have to re-create this combination at home! Accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. I'm not sure if I'd call them fries though. They were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. It was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a \"frip\" if you will. \n\nI also sampled the croque monsieur and the chicken and mushroom crepe from my family members. Both were tasty as well! My one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. Why was it cold? The bread wasn't warm so the cold butter didn't make sense. \n\nFor a nice restaurant on the Vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. The space was a bit cramped though. Be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table."

  "text" : "By far one of my favorite restaurants, in Las Vegas and overall. I ate at Mon Ami before I started Yelping, and I realized I never left them my review. I miss this place, be sure to stop in for brunch or a nice dinner when you're aain town.\n\nThe duck confit is simply divine. If you're in the mood for soup, everything is absolutely delicious. My personal favorites are the obvious, French onion, and potato leek. The potato leek soup is smooth, and a perfect blend of flavors. Any of their sandwiches are a good choice, beef dip and another with chicken and caramelized onions were both super delish. If you're in the mood for brunch, I highly recommend their waffles or an eggs Benedict (crab is yummers). They had an awesome bloody mary bar the last time I stopped in...take advantage if you enjoy them.\n\nThe service has always been wonderful. On nice days there is an outdoor patio, but the inside ambiance is also enjoyable. Dimly lit, pretty romantic. If you are undecided or have no clue about the menu, the servers here will help you find something. They always have made recommendations to me, even on the wine. Worth a visit, I recommend this restaurant to anyone in Vegas!"

And, it was worth it! The view was incredible & the people watching was even better. We had a great view of Jungle Josh -magician, comedian, hot mess, etc. rofl. It was pretty hilarious. The food was good, eggs Benedict for me & corned beef hash for my friend. We both enjoyed the experience. We attempted to go back again Sunday morning but the patio was closed for a private party.

  "text" : "This was one of the best meals I have ever had, hands down. And now I will be returning every time I go to Vegas!\nI made reservations for a birthday dinner by the front windows. When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess said we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for the window. SO worth the wait. We played on the slot machines right in front until the buzzer went off only 2 minutes later. \nOur hostess was so friendly and we got a full conversation in by the time we were seated. That never happens! She was also able to give us a gluten free menu for one of the members of the group. We were promptly given warm french bread in a cute baguette holder and the server gave the friend gluten free bread without even asking! That is a perfect way to get customers to return! \n\nFor an appetizer we got the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and garlic bread. We should have ordered these individually because it was heaven on a plate. Everything about this dish had me wanting more.\nFor steak frites (what else would you order), I got the Bordelaise with wine sauce and onions cooked medium-rare. This was a large, tender piece of meat with a pile of fries and plenty of caramelized onions. They really get their portions right! My friends got the Bernaise steak frites and that sauce was pretty spectacular as well. \nFor dessert, we got the profiteroles and I am convinced they imported them straight from France. Again, amazing. I highly recommend! Only weird thing about the meal was that they did nothing for the friends birthday, so I am assuming there was a lack of communication between the hostess and the server.\n\nTotal was around $60 a person for steak, appetizer, dessert, and split bottle of wine. For Vegas, and how great this meal was, that was a fantastic deal.\nOh and while this is all going on, the Bellagio fountains are going off every 15 minutes right in front of us."

I have been here 4-5 times since it was one of my GF's favorite restaurants (it is one of the Lettuce Entertain You places if you are a rewards member with them). \n\nMost of the time I got Steak Frites. The cut of steak you get is pounded very thin and to my taste always overcooked- despite ordering medium rare it always comes grey throughout, so that is a pretty big deal breaker. The fries themselves are ok, they are the very thin style, and you do get an insane amount of them. The steak, however, should be the star of this meal and it just isn't.\n\nThe one time I didn't get steak I got  a scallop entree and this was much better than the steak- the scallops were seared well and came with a nice sauce- if you go I would highly recommend this over the steak. \n\nSome random other items I have had\n\nFrench Onion soup- this is ok but honestly if you are accustomed to french onion soup at a steakhouse you probably won't like it- it is much more subtle than what we have come to expect from the dish in America\n\nEscargots- very good but VERY garlic tasting, hopefully if you are getting this you aren't on a date.\n\nDuck Confit- This was pretty clumsily done and dissapointing\n\nWhipped Cauliflower- this is actually pretty good- esp if you are trying to avoid potatoes for health reasons this is the side for you\n\nMacaroni Gratin- nothing special, best had elsewhere on the strip \n\n\n\nAmbiance- Many people like sitting outside as you get a good view of people walking the strip and the Bellagio fountains so if the weather is amenable I would recommend that."

Good food, good service, nice strip view outdoor seating. Can't complain."

If you're patient, ask to sit outside, or near the patio.  \n\nThe lighting on the inside is insanely dark, and if you're placed in the corner, you have to use your cell phone light to read the menu.  Some may call it romantic, but I call it a pain in the butt.\n\nFor their signature steaks, they use their own \"cut\" of meat.  Whatever cut it is, its pretty tasty and I don't know if its tender because they beat the crap out of it, or tenderize it with seasoning.  I don't ask... I just eat it, hoping its not old meat, that's creatively cooked.\n\nIts not the most expensive steak house, but its also not coffee shop cheap.  Dinner for 2 will set you back $70, and unfortunately they don't let you pay with your Total Rewards points."

  "text" : "***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***\n\nMon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever.  If you have been to Las Vegas, you have likely walked past this French brasserie; it is the one with the big outdoor patio just outside the Paris hotel that looks like either a great spot or a very hot place to have brunch or lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is from famous Chicago chef Jean Joho, who also runs Paris' fine dining restaurant The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Chicago's Everest.\n\nWhile I was not a fan of The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, I was looking forward to trying Mon Ami Gabi.  This French brasserie seemed like a good choice for a delicious but not too expensive brunch.  I really liked the look.  The outdoor patio can be nice during some parts of the year and the restaurant also has an indoor-outdoor dining area, which offers a good view and a lot of sunlight but still provides a French bistro-esque room with good tables and a comfortable temperature.\n\nMon Ami Gabi's brunch menu features a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes from Eggs Benedict and omelets to steak frites and sandwiches like the Croque Madame, which I ordered.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  The ham was too thickly cut and quite dry while the toasted bread was dry, hard and way too crunchy.  The cheese did not have that stretchy and melted quality that a good Croque Madame has.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#8hc0hKwEWBkyr-oSH8V1dA\n\nThe Croque Madame was topped, of course, with a fried egg.  Unfortunately, the fried egg was quite burnt around the edges.  The fries had a thin potato chip-like cut.  They were not super crispy, but I liked the soft insides contrasted against the crispy edges.  Unfortunately, the fries were quite salty.\n\nFor dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.  The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, it was a thick double fudge sauce. While I prefer the more traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce, the chocolate combined with the ice cream and pastry to make a satisfying dessert.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#3Vy7BG3KJjbNjcREFoUeJQ\n\nService was good.  My server was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.\n\nPrices were not too bad for their breakfast and brunch options.  Some of their steak dishes seemed pricey, but they were similar to other Las Vegas restaurants though Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced.\n\nBouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.  Bouchon is perfectly fine, but it feels very similar to the Bouchons in Yountville and Beverly Hills (in terms of food, the Yountville location is easily the best of the bunch).  Mon Ami Gabi offers a more unique experience for people on the West Coast (Mon Ami Gabi has several locations in the middle of the country and the East Coast).\n\nUnfortunately, the food at Mon Ami Gabi was simply not that good.  While I liked Mon Ami Gabi's service and atmosphere, Bouchon is a much better option if you desire a French brunch (or dinner); it would probably not cost you that much more either.  Comme Ca in The Cosmopolitan would probably also be a better option for French bistro fare than Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nLike most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking."

  "text" : "I made a reservation for one via Open Table and I'm really glad I did because it was very busy for lunch (12:30PM). I wasn't able to opt for the extra 15-minute wait for patio seating (it became a 30-minute wait by 12:45), but I think it's worthwhile.\n\nGetting to my table was quite the ordeal. I was told that my table was being prepared when I checked in, however, I was still waiting after several other groups, most arriving after I did, was seated before me. I finally approached them after almost ten minutes and this was followed by a few more minutes of \"here's your table, nope, it's not available, waiting awkwardly, walking around the dining area, here's another table in the dark, there's other tables available, but not for one person, etc.\" It's a long story and I've spared the details. I was finally seated at a table next to the window overlooking the patio and it was very pretty. \n\nBecause of the lengthy windows and almost dome-like ceiling of this area, it's a wonderful alternative to their coveted patio dining. You still have a really great view and the light is magnificent (probably not so much in the summer). Although, if you sit right along the glass, like I did, you are awkwardly close to patrons on the other side. Besides the odd setting, I think this indoor \"glass room\" is better than actually sitting outside. You still get all the benefits of the restaurant's location without the car and foot traffic, outdoor elements, and people gawking at you.\n\nYou start your meal with fresh, warm baguette and creamy butter. I love that the loaf arrives in a \"Mon Ami Gabi\" bag, where you just tear off pieces to eat and it allows for easy travel. The bread had a great crust and soft, chewy center. Delicious.\n\nI had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne ($14.95), oven-roasted snails in garlic herb butter, and Seafood Crêpe ($15.95) made with scallops, shrimp, peas, and cream, served with a frisée and vinaigrette salad. The escargot was delicious! Especially that butter. Since it's served in the specially-made cast iron pan that it was baked, the dish is still warm until you're done. The \"sauce\" is extremely fragrant and went perfectly with the baguette. The crêpe was wonderful, filled with light cream and peas, topped with scrumptious scallops (it comes with two pieces, however, they're most likely one big scallop sliced in half) and plump shrimp (three nicely-sized crustaceans). The light and refreshing salad was a great companion as well.\n\nService was very pleasant and quick to respond to my needs and necessity to finish my meal in the allotted time. The beginning was a bit shaky and it did cause my having to rush through lunch, however, I was very pleased with the table and the view made me smile. It also helped that the weather was gorgeous! I would love to dine here again, preferably for breakfast and/or brunch and dinner. I believe I've only visited once previously, approximately 7-8 years ago, for dinner, but I don't remember much!"

Like, how can you go wrong with one of the most tender cut of beef, right? But at Mon Ami Gabi, how can you go SO right with it that all other ones you had became eh??  The piece of filet mignon was small (as usual like most other steak houses), but the char on this one was superb. Not to mention the merlot glaze totally compliments it! The frites that come with it filled over 2/3 of the plate, but they shaped a bit flat, but super delicoius and crisp! Dip them in the merlot sauce, and they're still good. The french green beans, as a side, was so buttery! \n\nThe service was just okay though.

The steak bordelaise was a bit bland and the cut a bit thin for my taste; the steak merlot on the other hand seemed overly sweet. The fries that came with the steak were oddly not bad.

  "text" : "Une brasserie vraiment français, on the Las Vegas Strip? Mais, bien sur! Having been to France many times, Mon Ami Gabi reminded me so much of a real Parisian brasserie (casual restaurant and drinking establishment).  Especially the open-air tables on the patio facing the Strip, if you are lucky enough to get a table there. Unfortunately, even with reservations (very much needed) you are not guaranteed a table on the patio during meal times. \nOther than our obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains, though, this was a pretty nice experience. It had all the bustle of a real brasserie, and briskly efficient (and even a bit snooty) service from an older French waiter. The special entree of the night, 2 gorgeous lamb chops, was really a standout. Steak au poivre was also very good. I was surprised the duck leg that I ordered was listed as an \"appetizer\"! It was the biggest, most delicious chunk-o-duck I've ever eaten (a bargain at $12.95)! I added the whipped cauliflower as a side, and not only had to share that around the table; but ultimately had to learn to make it at home b/c my husband liked it so much! \nFor dessert, the creme brulee was excellent--in this city, they better be on their A-game with a dessert that every restaurant here offers! (I'm making it my personal mission to try every creme brulee in this town :-) The only thing that was a little weird were the pommes frites: they weren't the hot, salty, shoestring French fries I had in the classic \"steak frites\" in France; but more like those dry potato sticks one gets in canisters. Some of us liked them, some did not.\nNot as expensive as we feared it might be (then again, only one of us had an alcoholic drink).This is NOT the experimental, uber-upscale French; this is casual French, with a lot of \"brasserie\" standards. \nAgain, get reservations! Then decide whether you want to eat inside and have a conversation, or sit outside and absorb the overwhelming experience that is the strip in the evening; because you won't be able to do both."

The setting is absolutely perfect for both people watching and a great view of the city.  We had the bacon and frisee salad upon our waiter's recommendation, and it was delicious. We also had shrimp cocktail and steak frites with merlot butter sauce as well as peppercorn sauce on the side. We decided we liked the peppercorn slightly better, but both were delicious. Our waiter was also a real character and kept us entertained, even bringing us a free dessert at the end."

It wasn't too sweet and not much fruit in the drink itself, except for some orange slices, but it was good. I ordered a second round. \nFood was ordered. Appetizers included Escargot - it came in a DELICIOUS garlicy sauce perfect for dipping the bread in. Could probably make this a meal with the bread and AMAZING sauce! I tried one of the snails too and it really doesn't taste like anything. But DAAAAAMN, that sauce!!! NOM NOM NOM! \nI had a Caesar salad and it was nothing to rant and rave about. When it hit the table I was actually rather disappointed with the presentation and how PLAIN it looked. The French Onion soup wasn't too bad, the usual saltiness and nice and cheesy.\nFor my entree I of course had to order the Scallops! I was actually NOT impressed with the scallops at all. I ate two of them and had the rest boxed up. Normally no matter how full I am, I would DEVOUR my scallops. They were just so-so. Not as tender, buttery, awesomely-delicious as ones I've had in the past. \nFriend ordered the special, Bacon wrapped filet medallions with fingerling potatoes. I like bacon, but I really don't care for bacon wrapped foods. I tried a piece with the bacon on it and wasn't really impressed. Then I tried a piece without the bacon and it tasted a lot better to me. \nFor dessert we ordered the Chocolate Mousse which was OKAY. It came with these little chocolate crunchy balls on top that I didn't care for too much, but the Mousse itself wasn't bad. \nThere was also White Chocolate Bread Pudding which was GOOD! I've had bread pudding before and never really liked it but this one was actually DELISH. \nI believe my dessert was THE best one out of the three: the Banana's Foster Crepe! So SO good with the caramel, sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream! It was fresh tasting and awesome! NOM NOM!"

As a student, Vegas trip usually means cramming as many people into the room as possible, getting drank, fist pumping to the music, and the morning/noon pho as hang over cure. A fancy dinner and show is not in the picture. \n\nMost of the places are owned by famous chefs that comes with a hefty price tag that we can't afford. wahhh :(\n\nMy friend told me about Mon Ami Gabi, and this change my Vegas trip completely. It definitely up my vegas trip class level by a lot without having to spend extra $$$$$. \n\nMost of the items on the menu are under $20 and closer to $15, except the steaks.  Thus without having to spend a fortune, you can sit in the patio by the strip and watch the Bellagio water show! \n\nI ordered the Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine which was fantastic. I would not make any modification to it. I love the way it is. \n\nThe friend who recommend this place told me that the escargots were really good. I didn't get to try because I am still on a budget...\n\nMy roommate and I shared flour-less chocolate cake. My roommate really enjoyed the cake. We cleaned the plate! The cake was topped with some sort of sour cream, which we didn't really care much and wished it was ice cream. \n\nTo start the meal, they give each table  a loaf of french baguette and butter. If you can't have gluten, you can still have some bread just ask! They even have a gluten-free menu.\n\nThey do take reservation; however, patio seating is first come first serve basis. The interior design gives a pretty old school classy vibe, so even if you can't get a table outside, it would still be a great experience."

The place was pretty busy and loud, which I liked!\n\nOkay. The food here was so underwhelming.. and just plain bad. I am sorry to say. I guess this is better for brunch/lunch and not dinner?\n\nService: Maria was nice and attentive.\n\nThe bread: Cold, chewy, a bad sign.\n\nThe wine: We got the Pinot Noir. Which was a bad decision for me because I just don't like alcoholic drinks. My mom was okay with it. It was alcohol-y. UndertOHnes of alcohol and OHvertones of ick. But I am just immature.\n\nThe appetizer:\n\nEscargot: Very meh and unspecial. Where was the flavor?? I felt like I was eating tenderized, flavor-less snails in a soup of sat fats.. which is what that was.\n\nThe entrees:\n\nSeared scallops: Whaaaat?? The heck?? The scallops were sandy to the bite and had this disgusting bitter aftertaste. So disappointing. We had to slice off the tops and bottoms to try to avoid the bitter flavor. The sweet pumpkin cream and mushrooms under the scallops were tasty, though.\n\nSteak au Poivre: Long, thin steak served next to a bunch of cut fries. I liked it, but it wasn't anything special! I could have made this meal, maybe even a tastier version of it, with some steaks and potatoes from Costco!\n\nToo bad. I was hyped up for this place for reasons that have everything to do with Yelp, but this isn't the first time I have been disappointed by fake French food.\n\nAlso, I got really sick after eating here and took some CVS antacids. It was not a nice night afterwards. I think this place has a great location and view and potential, but the dinner choices disappointed me! It was so below basic.\n\nI recommend looking elsewhere for a dining experience with focus on good food, because this isn't it. Eat somewhere else, even if it takes an extra cab ride."

Great food, good ambiance, great wine and amazing steaks and fries, and if you were seated on the patio (right on the LVB strip) you are bound to have an amazing time watching people walk by and catch a glimpse of the Bellagio dancing fountains. My parents were in Vegas recently celebrating my mom's bday, and I knew they had dinner reservations at Mon Ami Gabi, so i called MAG and asked if i would be able to buy them a bottle of wine (i live in LA). The lady that helped me, was Nancy M and i believe she was the restaurant manager. Nancy was great, she helped in handling everything for me. She set everything up very nicely, they were moved to the patio after they were initially seated inside, they presented them with the wine and explained that this was from me, they were also given a complimentary bday cake after dinner.

I'm typically not a French roast guy, but this coffee is all kinds of special.\n\nOf note - outside dining is walk-up only.

The world suddenly felt smaller. Only in Vegas. \n\nA short complimentary baguette started up our appetite, followed by our order of Fall Mushroom Soup, poured at the table into a bowl of creme fraiche, chives, and dried mushrooms. It prepared our palate perfectly for the rest of the meal.\n\nThe next dish, Housemade Country Paté, fell a bit short, needing flavor and a softer texture if one hopes to spread it onto the accompanying toast. It came topped with whole grain mustard and flanked by pickled mini cucumbers, pearl onions, and olives. \n\nThe Duck Leg Confit compensated by being perfectly cooked, tenderly shredding under the fork. The flavors met all expectations I had for this classic French favorite. It was accompanied by a bed of lentils.\n\nVegas is a paradoxical portal into a world of vulgarity and refinement, and at Mon Ami Gabi, I started the day with the latter, although I can't promise my escapades didn't end with the former."

I think everyone had cold food because again, feeding a large party at once is tough!\n\nFrites: Substituted the hash browns for fries because I've had them before and it was good. This time around, they were crispy, yummy, but cold.\n\nBloody Mary Bar: If you like em, they have a little bar where you can garnish it with whatever your heart desires."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi was repeatedly mentioned and recommended on my last trip to Vegas, so thought we would try it out. It's more of an Americanized French restaurant, but it's located inside Paris, and opens until very late at night, perfect for a Vegas stay!\n\nWe went for a very late dinner (because of a very late lunch) before we headed straight to the clubs. Many of us were preparing for an open bar night so we ordered accordingly! \n\nI tried the bacon salad and the baked scallop appetizer (not to be confused with the seared scallop entree). The salad was huge and would have been sufficient for lunch. The baked scallops only came with three, but with all the cheese, cream and caramelized onions on it, it was plenty. If you are hungry, I recommend going for the chicken grand mere or one of the steaks. They are huge!\n\nI also over indulged on the baguette for the table. Came with butter and some pickled veggies. Overall, great value for money and decent food in Vegas!"

I'd definitely come again and would recommend. \n\nDecor:\nVery cute and I loved that they had an outdoor patio area as well as a covered terrace. I would have preferred to sit in the covered terrace but it was such a nice day that we all opted for the outdoor patio. \n\nFood:\nThe food was delicious! I absolutely savored my (huge) brie cheese and roasted butternut squash quiche. My friend's seared scallops looked amazing and would have been my entree choice if I wasn't vegetarian!  The freshly baked baguettes were also very good--crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.\n\nService:\nPretty good, though they were not completely slammed during the time we went. My only complaint was that they did not allow our group of 5 to sit at a table for 8, but did allow a couple to sit at a table for 6... We ended up moving to a very small table for 4, but it all worked out. \n\nOverall:\nGreat place to dine. We didn't get dessert but instead, walked over to Sugar Bakery for some ice cream instead. I'd definitely come again and would plan to try a dessert next time."

The salmon was moist and the spinach had a light dressing. It couldve had more flavor but overall it was a nice light meal. My friend had the seafood crepe which had a cheesey creamy filling. It wasnt too heavy. The shrimp was really good. It was separate from the crepe. A good grilled season to it. I believe it was 5 pcs. The french toast came w blueberries and a blueberry syrup.

The half baguette brought to the table was hot and fresh. The food was very tasty and reasonably portioned. I shared the sandwich of the day with my husband since we weren't too hungry. It was served open-faced (easier to share) with toasted whole-grain bread, thinly spread goat cheese, with a few rounds of roasted eggplant, greens and yellow grape tomatoes all dressed in a vinaigrette. The beer was expensive, as was the food, but that seems to be nearly inescapable here. The menu seemed to have a lot of heavier dishes; surprised not to see a basic salad nicoise on the menu. I hate how expensive simple good food is here in Las Vegas, but this isn't a place where I felt like I wasted my money."

Having recently been to France and enjoyed bistro food there, we were pleased to be able to get it much closer to home. From the crisp, delicious baguette and butter provided to start our meal, to the onion soup, pate, roasted brie with honey and hazelnuts, and my open-face salmon / egg salad sandwich, everything was delicious. The frites, probably cut on a mandoline, were really crisp, a perfect fry. Although my friend had recommended that we sit outside (facing the Bellagio fountain), the wait for an outside table was ~45-60 minutes, and we elected to eat inside, which was fine and much quieter than many area restaurants. I would certainly return to Mon Ami Gabi."

Both versions of the Filet Mignon and the New York Strip Steak with bordelaise sauce were incredible. The Filet Mignon Au Poivre had more of a kick to it, but was cooked to perfection and delicious like the rest of the steaks we tried. Our knives slid through our juicy cuts of meat like butter and each bite was rich with flavor and spice. I also ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir, which was light and fruity. For dessert we tried the crème brulee, which was decadently rich and caramelized.\n \nReservations at Mon Ami Gabi are a necessity. I reserved through my Yelp App via OpenTable, which was easy and convenient. The patio is prime for people watching; the interior recalls a Parisian bistro.

Since I was back in Vegas with my boyfriend I raved about how much we had to go. Well when I visited last night I was extremely disappointed. The fish was very bland and the chips seemed a little hard and old. I'm not sure what changed over the years but it was not a change for the better. We were seated quickly because we ate inside and the caesar salad and baguette were very good. Thus the 2 stars and not 1. Our bill was $65 for dinner and so not worth it.

Super thin pancake almost to the point of being a crepe. Fresh marmalade, cream on the side, and a lemon half to juice.

I ordered a caramel latte and it had no caramel. I told the waitress and she said she would check. When she back she told me they were out of caramel and offered another beverage, which I replaced with tea. For breakfast I ordered the eggs Benedict special which replaced the Canadian bacon with mushrooms. this was pure perfection... I laid my knife into the egg to watch the yellow gloriousness ooze out and it was perfect. The second offering was over cooked and I was highly disappointed. I told the waitress and she fixed it immediately. The third issue we had was with the coffee service. Twice I had to get up and track down someone to refill my wife's coffee. This place is located perfectly on the strip and has a warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere. The outside patio is perfect for enjoying your meal.

But I felt compelled after my, I guess we will call it \"breakfast.\" \n\nFirst off, it should be called \"break-slow\" because service and wait was far too long. Granted, the place was kinda busy but there were many open tables and we were seated immediately. I ordered coffee and waited a long time for \"cream.\" It was really milk in a cup which is ridiculous. A French restaurant uses milk for creamer? I didn't believe it until I drank it straight from the cup... My guess is 1% or skim... Better with Cheerios than coffee. Anyone who takes cream with coffee knows that is a straight up SIN. \n\nNext, I should've been forewarned of the food quality when the people next to us sent their food back and complained It was the second day in a row doing so. Much like their complaints, my food was cold and overall inedible. The bacon and hash browns were ok, not too bad but the eggs were completely runny and the toast was hard as a brick. I used the rock frozen butter they gave me and grated it through the bread! Haha, too funny. I stabbed the butter with my knife and it would not go through. Some things you just need to be there to see. \n\nSo all in all paid way too much for food I could not stomach. Waitress knew I was unhappy but was uncaring. Too bad, I had high hopes...

We wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. There were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on Mon Ami Gabi for our \"Fancy Dinner\" event. Boy were we excited!\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. Along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. The place just exudes a romantic vibe! It's located directly under the Vegas version Eiffel Tower and along the strip sidewalk. The lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. Wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. Man, we were excited! Our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. Our server, although I can't remember her name, was super sweet! She was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. What I really liked about her was her efficiency! We had a 13 person party and she was still on it! Our food came out hot and ready in record time! For our apps, drinks and meals, here's what we had:\n\nChateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point! It was soft with a sweet finish. Definitely an everyday kind of Bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. This wine went great with my meal!\n\nWarm Brie Cheese for $12.95 - Served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. I love brie. This combination was no different. Whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. \n\nChicken Liver Mousse Pate for $11.95 - First time trying this.  THE BEST THING I HAD THAT NIGHT! Served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. The burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. This is MUST TRY, so delicious!\n\nBaked Goat Cheese for $11.95 - Another great dish. Tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. The cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. \n\nSeafood Platter for $49.95 - What a platter! Stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! There were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. \n\nBone in Ribeye for $39.95 - This was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, PERFECTLY cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. The steak was delicious. The right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. AH-MAZE-ING. The bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. The fries were flat and super crispy. Really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. \n\nWhat a meal! This place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants I've tried here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves THE BEST pate! I will for sure be back, time and time again.  Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I'll never forget!"

(Note that reservations are for indoor seating only, since outdoor seating is still first-come, first-served.) We came in at around 11:30, so there was really no need for reservation, but they still definitely get bonus points.\n\nThey start you off with a warm baguette and butter, and it's positively delightful. Definitely gave it that Parisian restaurant feel (although in Paris, they don't give you your table bread wrapped in a paper bag stamped with the restaurant logo). The bread had the signature crisp French bread exterior coupled with the pillowy, light interior.\n\nThey also gave us a small shredded carrot salad appetizer, compliments of the chef. It was nice, but not really anything worth writing home about. It had a nice acidic kick to it, but was still a bit too liquid-y for my liking.\n\nWe ordered the escargot appetizer, which came heavily sauced in basil butter. The snails were tender (note that they do not serve these in-shell -- most snails don't really come in their shells, anyway -- they're usually re-placed in re-usable shells just for presentation). And the basil butter was so good for dipping, they needed to bring us another loaf of bread. \n\nI also got the French onion soup, which was warm, complex and comforting. Great stuff. My boyfriend also got the salmon, which was good, but not really a stand-out. I've had better salmon, that's been better seasoned and with a better exterior texture. \n\nFor dessert, we also got the profiteroles, which were delightful. The vanilla ice cream, plus the drizzle of really good quality chocolate made it the perfect way to cap off the meal. Add a glass of pinot, and I was set for the night.\n\nAll in all, this was a great place to grab a bite -- the prices were affordable (considering you're in Vegas), the service was on point, they're open pretty late and the food is delicious."

  "text" : "MON AMI GABI is really what most Vegas restaurants should be -- but are not.\n\n1.  Indoors/Outdoors.  They have dark indoors, a big glass room semi-indoors, and an outside patio.\n\n2.  In a great spot.  (Under the Eiffel Tower, across from the Bellagio Fountains.)\n\n3.  A broad menu.  (Despite being a 'French' restaurant, it's been Americanized enough for any visitor to find something tasty on the menu.)\n\n4.  Prices are strip reasonable.  Meaning you're not being r-ped, which more and more is a disturbing trend on the strip.  \n\nSIDEBAR\n\nI get it that some restaurants want to be exclusive and riff-raff free.  That a dashing man and his fabulous babe want to be dressed to the nines... nowhere near the overweight shorts and wifebeater clan clasping four foot tall plastic Eiffel Tower Diabetes Cocktails.   So if such places want to charge $60 a pound for fish (Hello MILOS) you're welcome to do so.\n\nHowever, too much of the strip is joining in this bank account draining pricing scheme.  Places that are inside dim strip hotels, with no view, inconvenient from the street, with limited menus.  If this trend doesn't stop soon... it'll be cheaper to gamble for your dinner at a roulette table.  Seriously --\n\n-- may I speak on behalf of all Yelpsters and say WE DON'T GIVE A CREPE IF TABLE GAMBLING IS DOWN IN VEGAS and that can't be used as an excuse to serve $25 hamburgers.   Vegas is supposed to be fun... not a grapefruit enema.\n\nEND SIDEBAR\n\nAnyway -- MON AMI GABI still gets that.  The service -- although not really French -- is quite good and the restaurant is more than accommodating.  They did something for us on late afternoon that no restaurant has ever done for me.  I don't want to say it out loud or it might ruin it, but let's say it's akin to offering a Happy Hour hours before the actual Happy Hour starts.  NO ONE DOES STUFF LIKE THIS... but Mon Ami Gabi did.  With zero complaint.  They warned us our food might take a bit longer... but it wasn't any longer than any Vegas lunch.\n\nIf you want a really romantic meal, this isn't the kind of place to do it unless you get a table on the street and you LOVE noise and crowds.  However, if you like a fun place that takes you out of Vegas while somehow being in the center of it -- give MON AMI GABI a try."

There's still a line when you have a reservation, and you can't reserve the patio which looks onto the Bellagio fountains. \n\nThey did a fabulous job of under promising and over delivering. We were 15 min early for our 8:00 reservation. Hostess said they were running 15 minutes behind. We tucked into the back bar, in the solarium (tres romantic!) and found two seats next to each other. Before we had our first sip the buzzer went off and we were whisked to a prime patio seat. The breeze was perfect, the outside temperate even more perfect, and the fountain shows - delightful. I wanted to stay all night!\n\nService was prompt and kind with a smile - plus he had great timing instincts. We asked for a gluten free menu. A baguette was then delivered, and within 40 seconds a second bread delivery was made to my husband: gluten free option!  Can you imagine...just by asking for the GF menu, the waiter knew to order GF bread. What love. \n\nI made the mistake of skipping lunch, then being ravenous at 6:00 pm, and then gorging on Garrett's popcorn (cheddar carmel combo). So I wasn't really hungry for dinner.   We decided to order the raw-bar platter for two for $50, cold and refreshing. The best bits of it for me were the prepared lobster and the salmon/avocado tartar.  We joked that we'll never go back to Maine because now that someone has perfectly shelled and chilled our clawed crustacean it will never be the same with bibs. \n\nI said no to dessert, and then they brought us a treat for the anny anyway. So delicious, so thoughtful...cut Celine Dion hitting high notes as the water spouts above the skyline.  Perfection. \n\n-fin"

We were in town for my stepson's wedding & his uncle Jay hosted a lovely family dinner at this charming restaurant.\nWe started with Escargot all around the table. Tender & beautifully prepared with butter & garlic, the likes of these snails are rarely found & everyone seemed to enjoy them very much. Delicious bread & butter was also served with our appetizer & replenished throughout our meal. Our host's wine choice this evening was Cotes du Rhone, an excellent offering & the perfect choice to accompany our appetizer & steaks.\nAs a fan of pepper, I could not resist Steak au poivre, which turned out to be the most popular order in our group. A few of our people ordered Steak Roquefort & Steak classique, and every one of us was pleased with our choices. Our steaks were served with classic Pommes Frites, Belgian-style french fries.\nEnjoying my steak cooked rare-medium rare, I'm always afraid that it will be overcooked, but these fine chefs delivered a perfectly rare Steak au poivre - exactly as I ordered. Very delicious, worthy of savoring slowly, and the total effect of atmosphere, the wine, and high quality food was akin to a mystical experience, like a brief sojourn into a lovely dreamworld!\nWe shared Creme Brûlée & Creme Puffs for dessert. Both finely done & perfect postludes to the entire show.\nOur only glitches were quite minor.  The street-view dining room was quite chilly, which made our ladies a bit uncomfortable. If this concerns you, I suggest trying another area of the restaurant on your visit. Otherwise, our waiter was not certain which guest was to get each dish, a typical problem that should be expected in a large dining party that orders very similar items. These are not enough to keep us from returning - in fact, we look forward to it!"

Awesome restaurant.   Awesome service.   Awesome food.  Highly highly recommended.  Don't come to Vegas without coming here!!!!"

We ordered some mimosas to start, they were good but it tasted like there was 0 alcohol in it :/ I ordered the salmon eggs benedict, it was very satisfying~ but nothing I can't find at any brunch spot in la. I tried some of my friends seafood crepe, never tried a seafood crepe but it was pretty good. The food was good, nothing special, it was good to just try. But I do like the ambience and decor of the restaurant. Maybe it's better for dinner than brunch."

We ended up spending about $80. \n\nThe location was ideal (at the food of Paris hotel...shocking I know LOL), where we sat was killer....outside....highly recommended for breakfast.\n\nFood - I had the Smoke Lox Eggs Benedict.....Delicious!! My mom and GF had the special which was a spinach and tomato eggs benedict, they were signing its praises all day long. Oh also, fun fact....they make their own English Muffins.....need I say more?! We also split the lemon pancake (probably NOT the real name of the dish), and it was very flavorful. Plus the pancake is a crepe style...which only made it that more delicious. On the menu they had a Nutella and Banana pancake...how I couldn't convince my mom and GF to get that I will never know. The coffee was pretty good as well.\n\nStaff - Nice, friendly, fast. They were busy and checked in on us every once in awhile. It wasn't the type of place where you need a lot of attention. You just sit back enjoy some coffee, people watch, and have a great breakfast. The staff seemed to understand that which was nice. \n\nAmbiance - It really did feel like a Parisian Cafe. The decor was very nice and even the coffee cups gave me the illusion that I actually was sitting at the base of the Eiffel Tower enjoying breakfast."

  "text" : "The service was great here and it was decent French-esque food. The inside is dark and candlelit. Try to get a patio seat if possible. We weren't able to. \n\nFirst, the good: omg the baked goat cheese. OMG THE GOAT CHEESE. The cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. It was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. It was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. Unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. \n\nWe also had the warm brie. I love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. Unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. I ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. \n\nI had the half portion of mussels and the frites. I didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. I dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. All overcooked and shriveled. Even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and I didn't eat many of them. The mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. \n\nMon Ami Gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. I didn't try it, so I can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. \n\nWe were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served Profiteroles with sparkler candles. They were festive, but not incredibly delicious. Then again, I always have high expectations for French pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica Eiffel Tower on the Vegas strip. However, it was pricey enough to expect better food than we got. \n\nMy advice? Come and gorge on cheese, bread, and wine. Do as the French do and your meal will be more satisfying."

  "text" : "Service here is awesome. I had originally made reservations for 8:15 after being told 7:30 was unavailable. We got hungry so I got there at 7 and asked them what the wait time was. The response was 45 minutes to one hour for a party of two. I let them know that that was fine and I had reservations at 8:15, so I would take whichever availability came first. The hostess then said that since I had reservations, they would take me right away because it would be unfair for me to wait. I told her we would be staying at Paris anyway so it really was fine, but she insisted and we didn't wait at all! The waitstaff is also courteous and well-spoken. Food came promptly and warm. I couldn't have asked for better service.\n\nBreakfast: \n\nSpecial eggs benedict: consisted of bacon, spinach, and tomatoes with a side of hash browns. I didn't think it was all that special. It was good/okay, but nothing outstanding. The english muffins were very... toasted and a bit difficult to bite into. There was very little spinach and only a small piece of bacon. I think it was one bacon slice for the entire plate. The hollandaise sauce was bland and seemed watered down. The hash browns were good, however it was salted unevenly so we got little pockets of salt here and there.\n\nMushroom omelette with egg whites instead - consisted of mushrooms and brie cheese with hash browns and a slice of toast. Omelettes don't usually wow me since it's such an easy breakfast item to make. They didn't skimp on the brie although the brie wasn't a strong one. It was okay. I did like their bread though.\n\nDinner:\n\nDinner starts out with a warm baguette served with butter and a small pickled shredded root vegetable \"salad\".  Last year it was carrots, this year it was jicama.\n\nFilet mignon merlot - The filet came out really fast this time. I would say our food came out within 15 - 20 minutes of ordering. The filets were ordered medium well and they were cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust. The potatoes came warm and perfectly salted and crisp.\n\nVegetable Farcis (last year) - It was so flavorful and bursting with flavors I didn't feel I was missing out on anything. I hadn't been that excited about vegetables for awhile. I was very impressed with a steakhouse creating such a unique vegetarian dish. It consisted of herbed quinoa on a bed of sauteed tomato/sauce and topped with grilled zucchini, squash, and eggplant. Some of the vegetables had a creamy stuffing that was pretty decadent.\n\nBananas Foster Crepe - The caramel sauce is sweet and nutty with the bananas perfectly sauteed to remain firm, yet have that nice cooked banana flavor. One mistake I find many places make when making bananas foster is overcooking the bananas to mush. I don't think I detected any rum; the caramel is very strong so if there was any rum, maybe it brought out the caramel flavors. The crepe batter they use yields a nice thin, slightly chewy crepe. I'm not one to favor the crispy type crepes so this was perfect. Inside the crepe is vanilla ice cream and on top is a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nStar items - filet mignon merlot, bananas foster crepe."

I had the bacon, egg, and cheese crepe and a side of fruit.  My wife had a quiche that was both good and enormous (we probably could have shared it).  My crepe was excellent.  The crepe was light and yummy, and the fillings were savory.  Normally, I don't expect much when I order fruit at a restaurant, but all the fruit were ripe and perfect as well.  (I'm so used to getting rock hard cantaloupe at other places!)  Service was really good too.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.\n\nIf you are near Paris, I would definitely recommend this place.  I want to come back and try their steak frites one day.  I would also definitely recommend this restaurant over Ile St. Louis on the other side of the Paris Casino.  The breakfast crepe that I got there was dry and tasteless."

That would have been even more incredible, but they don't start until 11am.  We were going to wait for a table outside, but noticed the enclosed patio/bar area was quite lovely and it was a bit windy, so we ate there by a window.  We split the eggs benedict which was on a homemade english muffin that was really good.  We then split the bananas foster waffle which was out of this world awesome!  The crisp waffle with bananas and that incredible warm, bananas foster syrup with the cool homemade whipped cream was beyond words!!!  \nThe only somewhat negative was our waitress was a little snooty... maybe that's the french way, although she wasn't french. Lol!  The other places we had been to in Vegas, the people were so kind and fun, so we had been used to that.  Would highly recommend this place and also the bananas foster waffle, though.  Also, wanted to mention there's a bloody mary bar which we didn't try, but it sounded interesting."

  "text" : "Since my travel companion and I were the only people dysfunctional enough to be wide awake (and starving) at 7am on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided to take advantage of the situation and have a power-breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi -- a spot that's notorious for endless lines and waits for those foolish enough to show up without a reservation.\n\nMy instinct was right:  At 7am on Saturday morning, the restaurant was empty, and the two of us had our choice of tables with no need for reservations or waiting.  It also helped that the morning was glorious -- 70F, a gentle breeze, and perfect for leisurely meal on Mon Ami Gabi's sprawling patio, right on the Strip and across from Lake Bellagio.  (Sadly, the fountain show isn't running at 7am, but there's always abundant people-watching.)\n\nI'm not a caffeine person, but mornings in Vegas require it.  A pot of black tea for me and endless refills of black coffee for my guest were just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe portions at Mon Ami Gabi are behemoth, so we knew that one small plate and one regular plate would be more than enough food.  We started with the fruit salad with brown sugar and yogurt, which was simple but fresh and tasty.  We also shared the turkey and egg white omelet, which is served with toast (+ butter and jam), hash brown, cherry tomatoes, and avocado.  The omelet was certainly pretty to look at, but a bit bland.  It needed pepper, or hot sauce, or something to give it a little kick.\n\nThe real winner, surprisingly, was the hash brown.  I don't think I've ever had one so crispy and flavorful.  I say this as someone who normally shies away from heavy, carb-laden breakfasts.\n\nService at Mon Ami Gabi is....typical Vegas.  Stiff and not especially friendly.  I don't  expect much else at a restaurant that probably gets zero regulars.\n\nThat said, I think I know exactly where I'm headed next time I need a tasty, healthy, and relatively affordable breakfast on the Strip!  =)"

Mon Ami Gabi is just like that.  \n\nWe wanted to treat ourselves to an expensive meal that included excellent steaks.  The restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday night but we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  The place is very well decorated and our waiter was cordial and friendly, though there did not appear to be any attempt to develop a convivial relationship with our table.  He got the order quickly, made it arrive, and delivered a check.  More than satisfactory if I was at a Marie Calendar's, not what I expected when I was spending over $150 for 3 people.\n\nWe ordered our steaks and settled in since, I assumed, they would take about 15 minutes to be prepared and cooked properly.  They arrived 6 minutes later.  They were thin pieces of meat, so thin that it was impossible to know if mine was medium-rare or well-done.  It seems all they do is have a conveyer belt of steaks that they cook, throw onto a plate, and pour the sauce on top.  We were in and out after about 20 - 25 minutes.\n\nIf you just want a meal without any fanfare and don't care about service, I'd recommend this place.  But for the price, it really fell flat in providing any kind of upscale service or meals that you will remember.  It's Paris in Disneyland."

We walked in for breakfast and were seated after a couple of minutes. We took a table inside to avoid the wait and the decor was nice but it felt cramped. People passing by were constantly bumping my chair. The server came out, brought us our waters and took our orders. Within a reasonable amount of time our food was out and boy was it delicious! I ordered the mushroom and cheese omelette (mushrooms, brie, chives) and my fiance ordered the ham and cheese omelet. We were very pleased with our meals, but that first glass of water that was brought out? Yeah that was the only one we got for the duration of our meal. I finished my glass half-way into my meal and kept expecting the guy filling waters to stop at our table. However, I watched him THREE times as he picked up a water pitcher, walked past our table, looked right at my empty glass and proceeded to give water to another table. And then he would walk back by our table to put the pitcher down. And repeat. THREE times, within about 10 minutes. And those were just the times I saw him do it. I tried motioning to him a couple of times but it's as if eh were intentionally ignoring us. It was incredibly inconsiderate. Furthermore, the waitress didn't bother to stop by once until she was ready to bring us our checks. At this point I was parched and asked for a water, which we didn't get until after we had paid. The food was good, but if I can't get something as simple as a refill of water and, even worse, feel as if I'm being ignored, I won't go back. Next time I go back to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi will not be on my list of places to visit. Very poor service."

  "text" : "There's a reason Mon Ami Gabi has over 3800 reviews and averages four stars. It really is that good. Definitely a worthwhile destination if you're looking for an excellent dinner on the Strip.\n\nService is impeccable, especially if you're lucky enough to be seated in Michelle's section. She took excellent care of our large party of twelve, answering numerous menu questions, accommodating my gluten free needs, and keeping the food and drinks flowing freely throughout the evening. \n\nWhile my dining companions raved about the filet mignon with merlot butter, I opted to try their oysters, flown in fresh from the Pacific Northwest and served with both the traditional cocktail sauce and a great mignonette. These beauties were pristine little taste sensations of the sea. Once I offered to share with my colleagues, it became apparent we would need more. Michelle, once again, to the rescue!\n\nMon Ami Gabi earned its fifth star by serving me fresh-from-the-oven gluten free bread, which I enjoyed along with the superb chicken liver pate. So traditionally French, and so amazingly delicious. (Don't worry, for  non-GF patrons, you get the normal, gluten-filled crusty baguettes.)"

  "text" : "Two Las Vegas regulars recommended this place to my friends and I when we asked for a cute place to have lunch where we could sit outside.  Well, we put our name on the list to sit outside and the wait wasn't that long... but when we go to the table, boy oh boy, were we outside!  Smack in the Las Vegas heat and sun.  Strangely every other table was under an umbrella, except ours.  We couldn't do it.  So we asked to be moved inside.  Luckily, they had an indoor patio, which was still nice.  They were very accommodating, our server was a sweet lady.  She took excellent care of us!   We of course started with a pitcher of FRANgria!  You got that right... Frangria!  It was interesting... had a hint of Rosemary.  And they serve you a loaf of fresh warm french bread for the table.  So good!  We ordered the Brie as an appetizer, that was AMAZING!  Our lunch itself, it was okay.  The Kale salad I got, nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad.   And the server was so sweet, she heard I was celebrating my bday so she brought out a little cream puff with a candle and had everyone sing for me.  Totally special and sweet!  The location of the restaurant is so nice, right on the strip across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  Right after lunch, we all stood outside and took a selfie in front of the \"Eiffel Tower!\"  Our little trip to Paris... on a budget of course!!!"

We were lucky because the morning we went, the temperature was about 70 degrees and made for a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy breakfast and people watching.  \nI ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle and my wife ordered the Blueberry French Toast.  Both were perfect!  Servers were friendly and attentive.  Couldn't ask for a better way to start the day."

We went to the check in and there were 4 people working the check in counter, and it seemed nobody knew what to do.  They said, oh, two more minutes please.  (Then why did you buzz us?!) Two different people said, \"Melissa, party of 4\" while we stood directly in front of them and said Melissa, party of 4, yet it took another minute for someone to walk us to our seats outside.  It took some time to get served, and while 3 of us enjoyed our coffee once we ordered, it took at least 10 minutes for our fourth girl to get her cappuccino.  The menus were disgusting, covered in food, and one of the coffee cups had to be returned because it was dirty.  The menu was surprisingly filled with lots of options.  I had the eggs Benedict special which was just okay.  The eggs weren't juicy which is the whole part of eggs Benedict, the yolks were 3/4 of the way cooked.  My friend ordered the nutella waffles and seemed disappointed because the nutella was inside and pretty sparse.  Don't come here for the food, its just okay...come here for the people watching!"

Expect beautiful Parisian decor, an inviting patio perfect for brunch and people watching, friendly staff and an incredible gluten free menu. \n\nThey have a great selection of brunch cocktails, including a huge variety of champagne. \n\nWe opted for lunch since it was around 11am. My friend got the Croque-Monsieur with frites and it was a huge, stacked portion covered in creamy bechamel. Yum! She couldn't finish it, so if you have a smaller appetite, consider sharing this rich delight. Each table also gets a freshly made french baguette which came out piping hot. I got the steak frites which was a grilled skirt steak with herb butter. There are multiple steak frites options but due to food allergies, I got the basics. It melted in my mouth and I ate every bite!\n\nFood allergy info:\nAsk for a Gluten Free menu before being seated. They have a ton of options, including gluten free bread (has egg in it), french onion soup (with GF crouton!), the frites are pan fried in canola oil (no soy here! woo!) and plenty of egg dishes that are naturally GF. I let my server know about my allergies and he took care of me. Amazing experience!"

  "text" : "This has been a go to place for my wife and I on our past several trips to Las Vegas. We have yet to make it there for anything but breakfast but reading other reviews it certainly is on my list for the next trip. (Which is coming up soon!)\n\nJust after the early risers and before the strip starts to heat up, Mon Ami Gabi is just the perfect spot for breakfast. Sitting on the outdoor patio is just an amazing experience. You can sit in absolute comfort, the sun not at its peak and just enough shade to set the perfect temperature for breakfast. People watching at this time of day and from this wonderful vantage point has always been a highlight for my wife and I. We watch as the street performers start to show up to lay their claim and observe the Vegas newbies (no offense to those that have yet to visit) try to find a place to eat, thinking Mon Ami Gabi is too expensive. We used to think that as well but several trips back we just went for it and gave it a chance. We have never looked back. \n\nThe service is amazing and you do really feel like you stepped out for a fine supper meal but this is just breakfast, right? Not in the least. The service is superior and the breakfast selections are great. While the food is prepared well, presented nicely and provides just the right start to the day it is the mood and atmosphere that really makes this place special. It may only be for the duration of your meal but for that brief time you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, transported away from the lights and sounds of the casinos and you are dropped into a calm oasis of fine food and service. Even some of the high end 4 or 5 star restaurants on the strip fail to offer that, failing to shield the diner from the constant reminders of money lost on the slots or providing shade from the neon glow that draws entices us to follow. \n\nYes the patio is on the strip but Mon Ami Gabi allows you to both be on the strip and miles away at the same time. \n\nCome for the food but take the time to break away from the pace of Vegas and enjoy this gem.  Reading other reviews it is clear that that there is more to this place than breakfast, so I am going to go back and give it a try, will you?"

I'm all for free shows, the view is AWESOME. My entourage and I sat outside so we got to see the fountain show which was really nice especially when we were stuffing our faces with fancy French food! \n\nThe free bread was pretty good, haha. Plow through this and ask for more! The service wasn't bad, the nice man serving us had to deal with us changing tables halfway through but he was totally cool about it!\n\n This place can get crazy crowded, make a reservation, it'll help! Well actually if you want to sit outside, it all depends on how busy they are. The day we went, I had a reservation but it didn't matter because we wanted to sit outside anyway. Cover your bases to ensure there's a table for your party. I think this was one of those places where I had to give them my credit card number to get a reservation, it's pretty serious haha! \n\nFood: I've had better French food in Seattle but I'm giving this place four stars for the experience. We all liked it very much, and despite everyone's different palettes, we were pleased with our dishes. I had the scallops, they were perfectly seared. The butternut squash was savory and complimented the scallops. It was around $25 for the dish, I thought it was fair. I also tried the escargot appetizer. I thought it was too oily, the snails were served in a pan with little circular slots. I think they were drizzled with a little bit of herb oil. I wouldn't order this again, but you can be the judge. The oil just made the snails unappealing, I've had escargot before but served in an actual sauce. I think that's a better way to cook them! \n\nPortions were generous. My friend ordered a salad and it was ginormous. All of us could have shared it, it looked good! My other friend ordered a sandwich and it came with a mountain of fries. Definitely a place where you could share if you wanted to! We walked all the way from Monte Carlo so we opted for our own and waddled our way back down the strip."

She said quote on quote, \"I loved this dish so much that I'll drive here from Summerlin just to eat this.\" My mother is a big scallop advocate. She loved it as well. She also got the french onion soup which unfortunately she only ate a little bit since she needed something to eat right away -_- \n\nMax is bottom line the best server we've ever had!

The people watching and the bellagio fountains across the street make this a wonderful venue.  Pretty good food for a gimmick restaurant, most tourist restaurants are usually under par in the food department.  Would recommend.  A bit pricey, but expected given the location."

They go out of their way to offer many gluten free options and even bring out freshly toasted GF bread and butter to your table. The waitstaff is always really friendly, you get seated quickly and the outside patio is the best. \n\nGiven the price, location, quality of the food and service this place will always be my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Definitely go if you get the chance. You can't go wrong with the steak, salmon or chicken - all fantastic!"

Were told it would be a 45 min wait for two for a table on the patio, but after only 15 min we were seated.  The view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was perfect with our meals.  I had scallops and hubby had roasted chicken.  Both entrees were very good.  Since we were too full from the delicious starter bread, we couldn't try their desserts.  We chose this place with the help of Yelp and were not dissatisfied."

She came by and took our orders, afterwards she never really returned to check up on us. We asked for medium +1 but we received a rare steak, we had to flag her down to get it corrected. At the end of the meal she didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything but rather just dropped off the check and told us gratuity was already included. I guess for a party of 5 they include gratuity already. I was over this place by then, so we just paid the bill and left. I won't be coming back anymore."

We ordered a few dishes to share--the salmon tartare and the steak au pouvre. Also got a carafe of the frangria since I can't resist anything with rosemary in it. \n\nThe warm bread and salmon tartare with homemade potato chips were probably the highlight of the meal. Although that pickled thing that looks like a miniature watermelon with a long stem and lots of seeds was nasty! What is that thing!? Why do restaurants serve these little devils mixed in with the delicious cornichons?? Gross.\n\nThe frangria, sadly, left a bit to be desired. Although it was not sickeningly sweet like some sangrias, it also didn't have the depth of flavors that the description led me to believe it would have. I couldn't taste the fruits and definitely could not taste the rosemary--which made me very sad. \n\nThe steak was also just okay. The cut was so thin that even though we ordered medium rare the only part of the steak that was pink was a 1cm slice toward the middle. I like my steaks juicy and flavorful, and this place, despite all the hype about the steaks, fell short of that cut. \n\nOverall it was still a pleasant experience and sitting on the patio watching Vegas life was fun. Just don't expect the best steak of your life, and don't eat those picked-mini-watermelon-w/stems."

Although I have to give a lot of credit to our server for trying absolutely hard to accomodate us despite of the big crowd. Came on a Saturday night with friends so obviously having reservation helped. They serve complimentary bread and butter and some kind of salad that I can't exactly remember the ingredients. The serving size was surprisingly bigger than I expected. I had the chicken grandmere with side of mashed potatoes. It was plain roasted chicken, thought it was pretty tasty but a little dry for my tastebuds. My friends devoured the filet mignon, oysters and bone-in ribeye and they seemed to enjoy it. I also had their onion soup with cheese, which I thought was very unique and tasty. For a group of 6, we spent a little over $200. We enjoyed our dinner for the most part."

The restaurant was super busy that Saturday brunch, but our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly.\n\nI had a wonderful quiche Lorraine, which was the whole quiche (!) and clearly cooked to order, which was a nice surprise. A tablemate had a burger, which he said was fantastic, and the wine list was shockingly reasonably priced.\n\nThe only downside was the overall price of the menu. I get that it's Las Vegas and it's on the Strip, but we had just come Le Diplomate in Washington, DC, which we also think is pricey, and even that seemed comparatively tame in comparison with LV's Strip prices.

Yes it's scortching hot in vegas right now but food, especially great food, does not like A/C!\nOur waiter was great, maybe a smidge too \"buddy like\", but both of us really enjoyed our food, the fact that we could hear each other speaking and the lack of greatly needed sensory overload. After all isn't Las Vegas a luxurious version of ikea, aka the rat trap. Clearly you can tell Vegas is not my scene necessarily but would recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone, including the typical french man. So thanks to you yelpers in making what could have been an impossible task in finding good dinning a painless and enjoyable experience. J."

We enjoy the warm Brie as a starter.  The chicken and steak are so tender and flavorful.  I especially love the steak with the blue cheese sauce.  It melts in your mouth.  You don't even need a knife to cut it.  Some say the prices are high but I think the prices match the quality of food you are getting."

The escargot is here is the only place Ill order it, streaks are great... make sure you sub out the pomme frites if your not a fan, they're not normal \"french fries\" as the name suggests, but rather wide long potato sections (think pickle shape) so you're not traditional, who cares? Do make sure you ask to be seated on the \"outdoor/indoor patio\"  you won't be outside per say, but dinning out of the old school dining room without having to see/hear thousands of drunk tourists ruining your dining experience.  \nits great food without being too uptight."

We could of gotten something else cheaper and more delicious. \n\nWe ordered the prime steak and eggs, and it was horrible. The wait was long, and the best part was the toast.\n\nWe also ordered the steak sandwich with the dip. IT WAS AMAZINGLY delicious. All the juice and onions blended together. I would definitely reccomnend this. \n\nI would give this place 3 stars, but the extra star is for the great view. There is also an abundance of staff here. and so if you were to come here I reccomend making a reservation for outside seating."

  "text" : "Terrible idea and it was a disappointing meal on the strip I'll never have back.  I don't understand how this place got such good reviews.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to come here last time we were in Vegas.  I had high hopes given the pictures and reviews.  Lighting was on the dark side and environment was loud, if you're into that sort of setting.  The bread was good, and that's a problem if that's the best I can say about the meal.  My girlfriend had the steak frites, which was dry and rough.  I went for my usual order of choice at most restaurants, the bone in rib-eye, medium rare.  It came out looking great, and in hindsight, maybe the dark lighting helped.  It was \"quite literally\" the worst rib-eye I've ever had.  Either I had a dull steak knife or that was one tough SOB.  Trying to chew through that thing and not being successful confirmed that it was the latter.  I thought maybe it might just be that particular part of the cut and continued.  But time and again, every piece I had just added to the disappointment.  The only beneficiary of this meal?  My dog, who got the bone and leftover.. hopefully he enjoyed it more than I did.\n\nDon't see myself coming back here again any time soon."

We stumbled into Mon Ami Gabi not by choice but because someone, I shall not name names, needed to void.  \n\nWe were lured in with the cool breeze but for some reason I wanted to sit outside.  It was a mistake because it was scorching hot but also a good decision because we got to watch the water show at the Bellagio at least twice during our meal.  \n\nI thought the price was surprisingly fair for being a restaurant located on the strip.  We order escargot (favorite), chilled seafood platter, grilled salmon and spinach salad, and of course a glass of wine for me.  The total was slightly north of $100.\n\nThe escargot was pretty good, it was softer and less chewy than other placed tried.  The seafood platter was amazing, it came with maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and salmon tartare.  This dish was shared between three people.  And lastly, we had the grilled salmon salad which was delish.  It had avocado, walnuts, blueberries, and a citrus dressing, so good.\n\nI will definitely make a stop the next time I visit Vegas."

As a veggie lover I used to love their vegetable platter which is now off the menu and replaced with some pathetic veggie broth thing that I could easily make (and it taste much better) at home.  If you are vegan or vegetarian just skip it and go to the Wynn or Encore where EVERY SINGLE RESTAURANT has excellent vegan options (many with vegan bread and butter).  Now for those people that don't care about veggies I will say the place has gone downhill in general. Last time we were there they were out of duck (so no duck confit at a french restaurant) and I think all foul for that matter.  We told the server we did not like the new veggie broth dish and did not like whatever my wife order in place of duck and she did not offer to take anything off the bill. It is the only time I have ever tipped just 10% at a fine dining restaurant and I haven't been back since."

First off, if you're parking in the Paris parking lot, I had trouble navigating inside the hotel to find the restaurant. Be sure to ask around or you'll be walking in circles like I did... It's must easier if you don't bother driving at all and just walk on the strip bc it's located right outside the Paris hotel...\n\nSeating was fast and plentiful even on a Saturday night even when we didn't make any reservations.. We decided to sit outside on the patio and for a great view of the Bellagio fountains. What a way to eat dinner!! Dinner and a view!\n\nI ordered the kale frisée salad with the mussels while the BF ordered the steak with peppercorn sauce. I must say, I'm not much of a meat eater so I'm not a big steak fan but I took a bite out of his steak and it was sooo tender and delicious! Very soft meat and flavorful!! I looked over to my BF and within minutes that steak was gone!! I took a couple of his frites too and I LOVED how crispy they are! Perfectly cooked! My kale salad was delicious! Loved their dressing and huge chunks of bacon with a perfectly poached egg on top!! The mussels were also delicious!! The BF kept dipping the complimentary bread into the sauce even after he finished his steak!!\n\nOverall, we had a lovely time at Mon Ami! Perfect way to start the trip!"

I'm really not picky about where I sit when I eat but I felt uncomfortable where we were placed. The table seemed right in the middle of an area where all the traffic flowed in. The waitress brought us our drinks (soda) and they turned out to be diet. She gladly exchanged them. For the prices listed in the menu I was expecting a bit more on my plate. I had the caramelized scallops, which came 4 pieces (25 dollars) total along with sliced red bell peppers. It looked as if it was missing something, the plate looked a bit bare to me. So I ordered a side of asparagus. The asparagus didn't come until the end of my meal only after I asked about them. My boyfriend got an amazing steak (27 dollars) made my meal look like a toddler's meal:) My meal, although small in size, was very delicious. I don't see myself ordering that dish in the future.

  "text" : "My GF had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked; so, during this stop over in LV, we decided to give it a try.  We were looking forward to trying the Beef Wellington, but upon sitting down we soon found out that it is their Sunday special, and since it was Thursday we were SOL on that front.  Ok, no problem.  Surely there is a lot of other good stuff here to eat.  We started looking over the rather brief menu.  We decided to go with a Shrimp Cocktail, the Summer Tomato Salad, and the fish special of the day - Sea Bass.  The Shrimp Cocktail was nothing special and very over-priced: $15 for 5 shrimp on a bed of ice with a very small cocktail sauce container.  The summer tomato salad was even more disappointing: a few slices of tomatoes spread over a plate with a basil leave or two, a few very small pieces of grilled zucchini, and an almost non-existent marinade.  I can make a more impressive looking and tasting tomato salad.  I understand this is a French restaurant, and smaller portions are the nom in Europe.  I have no problem with that provided the quality of the dish makes up for it.  Mon Ami Gabi's did not.  But the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, Gabriel.  From the moment we sat down, it was a lot of attitude, and a lot of waiting.  We were planning on trying a desert, but we got tired of waiting for our waiter after we finished eating, and decided to not give Mon Ami Gabi any more of our business."

Worst part about Vegas is that if it's open, it's busy. The hostess originally told us that they were not accepting walk-ins until 11 but my sister was clever enough to make a reservation through Yelp for 10:30.\n\nAfter losing money at the slot machines, we were seated promptly. Our server was a bit awkward but extremely helpful and courteous. We ordered 2 hanger steaks, 1 mac & cheese, and a kale salad. The hanger steaks were exquisite. They were super tender and the fries were super thin and crispy albeit over salted. The kale salad was okay. Nothing special. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good too though but I believe technically it would be shells and cheese. \n\nWe also shared a carafe of \"frangria\" and it was good but I would've preferred regular sangria. It was almost too light and juicy. It was almost like watered down wine. \n\nOverall the dinner was good but pricy. I would come back since everything in Vegas is expensive but at the same time it seems more popular than it deserves."

  "text" : "Bon appetitie! Mostly a steakhouse with a french flair. Menu is anglo friendly enough and yes, they have escargot to make it authentic. Entrees are varied with non beef dishes nicely done as well. Service is complete and polite, dining room is only slightly buzzy with chatter at your own table very easy and without intrusive noise from afar. Decor is rich and ambiance is strong. Prices are par for Vegas, good value compared to nonVegas venues, but no ten dollar steaks either. My salad was fresh, portions were good, food well prepared. One small gripe, the excellent baguettes are delivered with only a spreading knife to cut cut them. It's both comical and aggrevating to see the thrashing and hammering efforts that go on at each table to piece out the loaf with a totally ineffective knife. Pinching off pieces was the best fallback. Nice outdoor seating complements to comfortable dining room. Very worth of a future visit."

We ended up so blown away by the quality of food and service that we came back the next morning again!   Sampling only the breakfast options, Gabi aimed to please:  we have a dairy and gluten-allergic daughter, so we asked our friendly server, David, if the kitchen might accommodate a non-allergic waffle.  Not only did he/it do so but our daughter loved it!   Besides that, the other waffles, fruit salad, crepes, frisée with poached egg, incredibly flaky pain au chocolat and endlessly refilled coffee in the French-bistro-like environ, made for two very memorable meals and rendered Mon Ami Gabi nos ami pour toujours!  If only we could return for dinner!  Next time..."

  "text" : "My boyfriend and I decided to try french cuisine on our date night, since he hasn't really had french food. We ordered the escargot, which he loved. For me, I wasn't highly impressed, since I have tried escargot elsewhere. I felt as if it lacked the garlic butter flavor and tasted more oily than ever. \n\nOur entrees were the hanger steak with Merlot butter and the Dijon steak. Both had impeccable flavors. The Dijon steak had more burst of flavor than the hanger steak, but both were incredible. The frites were so delicious. As for the drinks, I ordered a frangria which was good. I ordered a small, so beware that if you are the only one drinking, it's plentiful. :) \n\nLast, but not least, we ordered dessert. The \"la grande profiterole.\" Let me try to explain this the best I can.... If an eclair and a cream puff mated and had babies, this is what would come out. Haha. It had vanilla ice cream in the middle too! It was so good, it makes me wanna slap yo momma! I would definitely come back and would love to try their lunch. The added bonus is their view of the bellagio fountains, if you are lucky to get a seating by the window or patio. :)"

Well fast forward 5+ years and on July 4th I finally found the time to eat here! Why did I wait this long? You always see a packed patio when walking/driving down. Entrance is located in the Paris Casino (not the main entrance) but off to the side. Arrived at lunch time with hubby and was greeted by friendly hostess who sat us inside the dining area. We had the lunch menu in hand so I decided to order the lobster roll. Hubby ordered the special that was off the menu. It was some type of sandwich with goat cheese. Both dishes were extremely yummy and I was surprised to see how much lobster they put in my sandwich. Service was great, our waters were refilled without having to say anything and our waiter was friendly and quick. \n\nMy only issue was how close all the tables were. Hubby had to move from his seat right across from me because he kept getting bumped by people squeezing through. \n\nCan't wait for my next trip to Vegas. I will be back to try other items from the menu."

Bread was nice and hearty to soak up all those flavors. \n\nThe menu is pretty diverse, but I think I found my go-to dish here.\n\nI'll be going back to Vegas for a long layover, and Mon Ami Gabi is definitely on my list for breakfast before heading out of town."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi had been on my wish list for quite some time. The most recent trip to Vegas allowed me to finally go this establishment and I was not disappointed.\n\nFirst Mon Ami Gabi is located right on the Vegas strip with both an indoor and outdoor section with a nice view of the fountains at the Bellagio casino across the strip. We decided to eat indoors since it was over 100 degrees that day. \n\nI ordered a mixture of appetizers that included the French Onion Soup/Onion Soup Au Gratin, the Chicken Liver Mousse Pate, and the Baked Goat Cheese. The goat cheese I'd only seen on a Spanish menu before so I was interested in comparing them. Mon Ami's take was nice and creamy with a tomato sauce surrounding it and a slice of French bread with an herb garlic mix on top to scoop up the food with. The Pate was nice and creamy and served with some toasted bread to it with. The Onion Soup was good but not as thick with cheese as I would have liked but had good flavor nonetheless.\n\nMy son got Prime Steak Sandwich which was served with Mon Ami's thinly sliced fries. He devoured it and especially liked the au jos sauce to dip it in.\n\nMy niece ordered the Cheeseburger that was served with fries as well and loved it.\n\nThe one drawback was my wife got the classique steak. Mon Ami has several steak preparations but uses the same cut for each one. My wife said it wasn't the greatest piece of meat so she was slightly disappointed.\n\nDespite that we would gladly go back to Mon Ami Gabi and I was happy to finally check this restaurant off my list."

The food is amazing, excellent wine list and very consummate sommeliers to assist with the right choice.  Ambiance is second to none, whether inside or outside watching the fountains at Bellagio while you eat.

Here's what I tried and what I can speak to:\n\nBaked goat cheese\nPate\nSteak bearnaise\nSteak tartare \n\nThe baked goat cheese lacked a significant flavor. I LOVE cheese, you can pretty much melt any cheese in the world and let me dip bread in it and I would be happy. This cheese was meh. \n\nThe pate was also not particularly tasty. My mom loves pate, and my girlfriend had never had it. I knew she would love it, but when I tasted this one I was surprised that it didn't have the rich flavor pate usually has. \n\nThe steak sauce for the bearnaise was realllllly good, and I loved that! The steak itself was pretty good, but didn't justify the price. I smothered it in sauce and it was really yummy though. \n\nWe were really excited about the French fries, they were more like chips, and they were good not great. They weren't fresh and quickly went cold and soggy. We asked for a fresh batch (one dish arrived with cold fries), and the very fresh ones were excellent... But they sogged up real quickly and were cold. The waitress said it was because the area in the greenhouse area we were in was the \"wind tunnel\" but it was still disappointing. \n\nThe steak tartare also was just OK. The spices were pretty good, but nothing that wowed or had you excited to take another bite. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food was pretty decent. However for the price, I expected more, and it didn't help that the service was very slow and we had different servers taking our orders and helping us. It was confusing, and even with multiple people we felt the service was really slow.  \n\nI wouldn't spend money here again based on this experience, but based on other reviews, I think I'll give it another shot with just my girlfriend and I at some point."

Additionally, the steak was butterflied to my surprise. I'd always rather be told if my steak is going to be butterflied... Sometimes I will change my order when knowing that. But, the Roquefort was delicious none the less."

This place wasn't my first choice but got chosen because of the fact they open late and we got distracted working up a sweat before getting ready.\n\nMade a reservation. Got there on time and was immediately seated outside with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. Matt was our main server. I say main because a few others were coming by to help drop off food or clean up.\n\nWe ordered some drinks (Sidecar #43 and forgot the other one) and the country pate to start off with the warm bread and whipped butter. The bread and butter was delicious. The sidecar was extremely sweet which neither my wife or I was a fan of. The other drink wasn't worth remembering.. neither great nor horrible. The pate wasn't bad. It was worth eating but I've had better.\n\nI ordered the 22oz Ribeye and my wife ordered the chicken. Considering the fact our server talked up cuts and mentioning it was what they were famous for.. I honestly wasn't impressed. I've had far better steaks for far less.\n\nOh! I also got the garlic spinach and creamed cauliflower on the side. The spinach was nothing to write home about but the creamed cauliflower was delicious and creamy. Definitely would get again if I were to come back. \n\nAlso one of the server's gaze seemed to come to rest on my wife's cleavage (Clay-VaahGe) quite often. I was going to say something but I do realize how great it is so I let it slide. Haha."

He said it was better than dining with Brittany, who's giant mug was plastered nearby, I beg to differ but was flattered all the same! (No one beats the queen of pop. No one.) \n\nWe cozied up on the patio around 8 ish (So early for Vegas! Mon Dieu!) but the plentiful coffee and juices quickly revived us. He was on a trip to SF, our mother ship, and I was in town for a Yelper Party (Hi Vegas Elites!) so we arranged this run in. Early means it was still cool out and not too busy, as this restaurant is smack dab in the middle of the strip. I suggest reservations regardless: It filled up by the time we finished (10 ish). \n\nI had a delightful ham and cheese crepe, the sauce was delicious and I ordered a crisp on the outside, soft on the inside baguette with plenty of butter (Dont judge me!) My dining companion enjoyed his meal as well! \n\nAs with all yummy things on the strip, it was expensive for what it was. But that's Vegas amores! One of the better meals I've had on the strip in my many visits."

Nice sear, tender and buttery with a hint of sweet from the pureed butternut squash each scallop was nesting on. My date had the steak with blue cheese mousse that I didn't get to try. I didn't want to mess up my tastebuds with heavy cheese and red meat because I was enjoying my sumptuous seafood so much.

Additionally it was located adjacent to a door (I think of the swinging type) with a serving cart occupying some of the table space. Rather than sitting down I asked for another table. We were shown to a table in the atrium area (brighter and quieter) which while smaller was significantly better situated. It turned out to be very fine. Both couples shared Caesar salads which were ample and very tasty. The baguette bread they make in house is wonderful and always served fresh and hot. For entrees we ordered two Steak Frites Bordelaise, one Hanger Steak, and the Caramelized Sea Scallops. While the Steak Frites were good, the Hanger Steak my wife ordered was tastier. The Sea Scallops my friend's wife ordered were very good and of course their signature hand cut fries are outstanding. My friend ordered the green beans but after the salad course was told they were out. He then ordered sautéed mushrooms which arrived halfway through the entrée. Five minutes later they brought a second order of mushrooms. When we informed the waitress that we already had one order she took the second order back. I'm not sure who those belonged to or went to. They formerly offered a plate of three small profiteroles (cream puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in warm chocolate sauce) for dessert but now it's a single grand profiterole which looks like a chocolate covered jumbo burger. We shared one and thought it was OK but I recall the smaller ones they formerly offered as being more tasty thanks to a softer puff. All in all a good meal at a reliable, fairly priced Strip restaurant."

It's a simple yet very elegant restaurant, which seems suitable for afternoon casual lunch or fancy business meetings or dates.  The menu had a variety of options from light salads and oysters, to fancy sandwiches, to meat hefty meals.  I ordered the tomato and basil salad.  The waitress said it was a pretty decent size and tasty.  It was indeed tasty, but not substantial in size.  I was thankful I ordered chicken with it because it is not enough on it's own (for most people).  It was very fresh and lightly seasoned with oil.  \nI sneaked bites from the plates of those around me....the yellowfin was delish and the goat cheese and smoked salmon sandwich is probably the best thing one could order from the lunch menu!  The combined flavor of the bread, cheese, salmon and toppings was one of the most decadent things I've eaten in awhile!  \nSo why 4 stars and not 5?  The service was lacking.  It's vegas...I expect above average.  Service was average from all the staff I encountered and no one seemed very personable.  Just kind of made me feel awkward.  Oh well, good eats - try it!"

It's one of the gems on the strip where the quality of the food far outweighs the price that you pay for it. \n\nI always order the Croque Monsieur (around $13 and a couple of people could split the plate). Frankly, it's so delicious that I never have the desire to stray from it. It's wonderfully toasted and the combination of cheese and ham are present in the perfect ratio so either flavor isn't too over-whelming. The hand-cut fries that are included with the plate are seasoned and fried to perfection! \n\nMy most recent visit was particularly memorable. Mark Z. was our server and he was extremely attentive, pleasant, and actually cared about having a conversation with us (quite refreshing considering we are in our early 20's). We showed up around 9am on a Sunday and were able to be seated right away on the patio which had a direct view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nWe started our meal with the baked goat cheese (about $12) and I can definitely say that I will never skip ordering this delicious plate from this point on. The tomato sauce was perfectly thick and creamy, the goat cheese was some of the best I have ever tasted, and the generous serving of garlic bread was perfectly buttery and crispy. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it! \n\nMy boyfriend said the coffee that he ordered was some of the best he has ever tasted... so that's highly recommended! \n\nAll in all, this place is absolutely incredible and I recommend it to every single person that I know that is taking a Vegas vacation!

No one did that thing where they bring you your food, and two seconds later, ask how is everything before you've even taken a bite.\n\nI had the french onion soup, the frise/kale/bacon salad, and a burger with blue cheese, bacon, and fried egg. All were awesome. I'd order all again.\n\nI highly recommend this place. Including two glasses of wine, the whole bill was $64.11 for two people.

Delicious. I am Paleo, so it was nice that they had options for gluten-free, although the fresh french bread looked pretty amazing. \n\nI came back the next afternoon for lunch/brunch on Sunday, and the food was great, but the service was sub-par. The server, I believe his name was Jose, was not friendly. Maybe he was having a bad day, which we all have, but it was unfortunate it had to impact our experience. My grandma asked him for a glass of ice, and he completely forgot to get it. Another server, at our request, had to bring it over. When taking our order, he seemed to be distracted. My mom asked if the kale salad had bacon, and he said it did. She asked if she can have it on the side. He said she could not because it was in the dressing. My mom got the salad, with bacon on the salad, and the dressing on the side (that had no bacon in it). The man who delivered the food was very nice, and took the food back. He apologized. Our server did not apologize, never said anything about giving us incorrect information, just said the other salad is on the way. \n\nI recommend this place for dinner. It was great. It was too bad we received the bad service at lunch, but I would still try it again."

We saw a fight the next day at the Linq.\n\nWe all shared escargots and mussels for appetizers.  The escargots were great in a very hot parsley butter sauce, and the mussels were very good also.  Be sure you have enough bread do \"sop up\" the sauce from the mussels.  \n\nFor dinner, I ordered one of the three dinner specials, sole with roasted potatoes and lightly sautéed spinach.  I was surprised that I got an entire sole (four filets).  Again, it was prepared very well, not overcooked.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a very light and flavorful chocolate mousse and a rich creme brûlée which was full of vanilla beans.\n\nWe lingered for over two hours laughing and watching the fountain show across the street.

Best way to dine at this place is by eating at their patio and preferably near the railing, no other exceptions.  Make sure to have a reservation especially if you decide to eat at this restaurant on a weekend or expect for your party to wait until the next table is ready.  Wait time, however, is usually nonexistent if you do show up early enough.  At least they have two bars conveniently inside the establishment that serve any alcoholic beverage you desire as you wait for your name to be called.\n\nWatch out for their daily specials as they're actually quite delicious.  One dish I tend to go for is their crepe stuffed with chicken, brie and apples topped with a beurre blanc sauce...amazing!!

Lady, I told you 3x my name is not Richard, your screaming the name in my face is not going to change that fact.  \n\nDespite that, however, the service during our meal was very good.  Our server was Jose and he was very busy but quick and attentive.  We had coffee, a bellini and a mimosa and all were strong and delicious.  \n\nI had the steak frites, my dad had the mushroom omelette and my mom had a breakfast croissant sandwich, and we all split the fruit bowl.  \n\nEverything was quite good EXCEPT FOR MY STEAK FRITES.  It is double the price of the other breakfast entrees and the meat was tough and the fries were weird.  I spent most of my meal wishing I'd ordered something different.  \n\nThe decor and ambiance here are lovely and reminiscent of Thomas Keller's Bouchon.  I'll probably come back here for breakfast/brunch next time I'm in Vegas but I'll definitely be skipping the steak frites."

  "text" : "I had an AMAZING experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!\n\nI made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to Strip traffic. The host joked around about me being late (which I appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!\n\nWhen making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). However, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the Strip). \n\nAs for the food, I had the filet mignon merlot, as well as escargot, sautéed mushrooms, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS!  One of the best filets I've ever had and reasonably priced. It was so tender and flavorful, and I loved the merlot sauce!  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  I would not recommend the sautéed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. \n\nThe service at Mon Ami Gabi was great!  Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked. However, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  The restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to Sugar Factory. \n\nIf you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but cannot afford Bellagio's high-end restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place!  I will definitely return!"

Everyone decided to have the steak so I obviously had a salad and scallops hoping to finish everyone's steak (which of course I did)!!! I had the soft boiled and bacon salad- oh so yum. Imagine a nice fresh salad covered in bacon and a warm soft boiled egg over. As you cut the egg the magical yolk pours over the salad. The salad also has little pieces of toast that soak up the egg yolk. I'm salivating as I write this. Then I had the scallops gratin which was amazing. Fresh scallops smothered in buttah and cheese baked to perfection. Get a piece of warm baguette to dip and you are in business. Then I tried everyone's steak and every style was amazing. I prefer the classic butter- medium rare but everyone style was wonderful. I love the fries too- they are fried but not greasy. Dip those bad boys in bearnaise sauce and you've got fireworks. We also had the chocolate mousse which was rich and decadent. For drinks we split the sangria which was flavorful and strong! Yum! Loved this meal."

We came because it seemed nice, not crazy expensive (it is Vegas-so pretty much everything is expensive!), and I had heard we could watch the fountains at the Bellagio if we requested the patio. We waited about an hour for the patio because it was a busy night, but we didn't care because the slot machines are right outside so we got to play a bit before we ate! The ambiance was really romantic, the service was excellent- our busser Nester was seriously on top of things with drinks, and the food was to die for. He got the steak bourdelaise, and I had the filet mingnon merlot, both with whipped potatoes. I highly recommend both. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and pretty much melted in our mouths! We also had the waiters wine recommendation, which was lovely, and the creme brûlée. Best creme brûlée I've had in a while! Also, I felt like the wait was worth it for the food, and the fountains did really help to make our special night even more special."

BUT the food really was yummy and definitely worth it since we were celebrating a special bachelorette party weekend.  Unlike many French restaurants, the portions were decent as well. They weren't what us Americans consider large but realistically, I think the portions were perfectly appropriate.  The food was delicious, just not as unique I would have expected from a French restaurant- but maybe their options are broader for dinner (we went for brunch).  The service was absolutely perfect!  Our server (who was clearly French) was friendly and checked up on us regularly (our water glasses were never empty) but he never felt invasive either.  He was polite and direct, and overall it was the best place we ate all weekend- comfortable and casual, yet classy and non-invasive.

No drinks, no bread, no attention from any of the many waiters/food runner around the place.  I had to go hunt down our waiter and ask for some bread and water or something..

It wasn't hoity toity or uncomfortable, it was more fun and could be classified as 'an experience.' The lights were dim when we arrived, and candles were lit on each table. The place was still bustling when we were seated a little past 10.\n\nWe were given a mini sized baguette off the bat, with butter and a pickled carrot salad plate courtesy of the chef. While our waiter was very much American, the few servers who brought food and water to our table appeared to be French, though I can't be positive if they actually were or if that is part of their job. My husband and I didn't understand some of things that were said to us until we gave it a few minutes of thoughtful consideration after the fact.... \n\n\"Ohhhh, he said CARROT salad.. Oh okay. Man, I was so confused for a second. Now the world makes sense again.\"\n\nWe started our meal with onion soup. I am a huge onion soup snob. My husband will eat anything labeled 'onion soup,' (including impostors from the likes of po' folk establishments and fast food joints) whereas I, personally, KNOW the proper production imparts a very specific broth color, and I know the appropriate flavorings required to be regarded as somewhat authentic onion soup. This, my friends, met my standards. The bowl was gigantic, so my husband and I shared it, and it was lovely. Onion-y, cheesy, bread-y...... Sigh.\n\nOnion soup... My Love.\n\nFor our main courses (Because we're piggies*), he ordered a steak frittes entree, and I ordered a hanger steak frittes entree. Both of our meals arrived in a timely fashion, and came with a huge serving of their version of french fries. They appeared to be pieces of potato shaved off and fried. Crispy in some areas, a good chew in others. Well salted. The steaks were good, but I admit I make a better hanger steak at home. \n\n---If you haven't tried a hanger steak before, also called a butchers cut, go to Whole Foods and get a couple. They are often lower in fat than other steaks, and they are soft and divine and easy to portion out. I make mine with a smoky spicy marinade, and it is amazing. Amazing like I almost cry when I take my first bite. Every time. \n\n\"Oh my gosh, how did I make something so miraculous? Sniff sniff. It's like my hands are a gift from the heavens, and I was created specifically to make hanger steaks.\"--- \n\nOf course, of utmost importance in any civilized person's life is dessert. Basically, I plow my way through meals just to get to dessert. Sometimes, I order dessert for dinner when I go to restaurants, because that's how smart I am. Skip the savory, all that chewing ich! Let me eat cake!\n\nWe ordered the \"La Grande Profiterole.\" Or something like that. It was a puff-type pastry, filled with a rich vanilla ice cream, that comes with a vat of fudgy warm chocolate sauce. The server who brought the plate to us first poured a bit of the chocolate sauce on top of the dessert before exclaiming something I still haven't deciphered, and after he left, we poured all of the remaining chocolate over the top of the unfamiliar dessert. \n\nChocolate sauce is to dessert what Ketchup or Tobasco is to dinner. Am I right??? I think that's on the SATs. You're welcome, high school kids. \n\nIt was amazing! Delicious! Stupendous! Superb! Excellent! Decadent! Rich! Sinful! The pastry was light and clean, the ice cream was smooth and heavy, the sauce had a deep almost alcohol-infused flavor, though that's just my opinion. Great success!\n\nI cannot wait to go back to this restaurant again in a year. I will salivate as I daydream and relive the memories for the next 12 months. I recommend!\n\nPS - Our waiter was lovely. He was so polite and patient and efficient. And quite tall. \n\n*Despite our copious food intake, neither of us are unhealthy or pushing any limits with our bodies. We ride bikes for miles every week and eat pretty healthily at home. Yet, I still sleep on a pile of sugar. It's just so supportive."

Pretty small also. Although I love their french fries, that was probably my favorite thing here.\n\nVIEW (5 stars):\nIf you get a seat on the patio you get to watch the Bellagio Fountains go off every 15 minutes. Beautiful view. You also get to people watch and see people take pictures of every little thing!\n\nSERVICE (5 stars):\nOur waitress was really nice. She acknowledged our special occasion but we did not get anything complimentary. \n\nBasically you're coming here for the view, don't come for food, and don't come to sit inside. Inside was still nice but at least outside you have an outstanding view that balances the average food."

Both the shrimp and the scallops were wonderfully seasoned and cooked to perfection. DELISH. OH, and I almost forgot about the baguettes! SO YUMMY.

It's a wet french toast, with fresh whip cream and fresh fruit. REALLY GOOD!  Location is great right on the strip. You will have to wait for an outside table but we sat in the atrium which was open and sunny with a view of the action on the strip. Service was a bit slow but I would say both our waiters were experienced and professional. We watched the one deal with a difficult customer very well. I was about to tell the customer to take a hike but the waiter remained friendly with the jerk.  My wife had the waffles one day which she did not love. Had the french toast (non GF) the next day and she loved it.  Bread is definitely their specialty!  The breakfast menu was not huge but was quite broad.  Overall solid 4 stars and we will be back!"

Good cafeteria food it may be, but calling it a French restaurant is generous. A friend and I both had different steaks that, for the price, I expected to be quite good. Instead, our cuts of meat were both mediocre quality and the \"red wine reduction\" I had with mine, resembled au jus more than a reduction. Would not recommend this place if you're used to real French food."

Good portions too so you could share.  \n\nUnfortunately haven't had a chance to sit and dine outside with the lovely views of the Bellagio fountain because the few times I went were extremely hot outside but I will once it starts to cool down.  \n\nThey have such amazing bread & it's complimentary.

And the later you go, the better chance you have of getting a spot on or near the patio where you can watch the Bellagio fountains while you sip your glass of bordeaux and await the most delicious steak frites with bearnaise sauce and pureed cauliflower.  Pureed cauliflower, you say?!  It's absolute heaven!  I've gotten several others addicted to this stuff as well.

Not on any of the must-try lists I'd seen before I booked our honeymoon, I wasn't sure about the detour.  The doorway is divided by a velvet rope, for exiting and entering customers. On our way out at about 10am, I could see why.\n\nThe bar and dining rooms are spacious and there's an atrium area next to the large patio, where most people were sitting. These were all good signs.\n\nThe coffee is excellent, and the mimosa is the perfect strength. Off to a great start, I debated between the ham and cheese crepe  and the mushroom omelette. The omelette won since it included a fair amount of brie. My husband chose the strawberry and vanilla waffle, which meant I got to try some of that as well, love being married :).\n\nHis waffle came with a saucer of freshly whipped cream, to add to the fresh strawberry slices already topping the waffle. Our omelette came with hashbrowns and toasted baguette slices. I also got butter and jam for the toast.\n\nI couldn't finish my half of the entrees, but they were both very nice! We were also given a dessert menu, but even my husband, after his breakfast and a half, couldn't eat another bite.\n\nThe patio was gorgeous, perfect for strip-side people watching. I loved the decor as well. And on the way out, dozens of people were on the other side of the rope, waiting to be seated. Mon Ami is a great start to Vegas scale festivities!"

Our server was a true gentleman and was knowledgeable about the menu, so that was also not a concern. But the food was where I was a little bothered. First let me say that the bread and presentation is delicious and well-thought out, respectively. I was super excited to eat the Steak Frites, which is usually one of my favorite combinations, but very disappointed in the fact that they use grain-feed beef and are proud of it, as described on the menu. EW. As a quality meat lover and Paleo-enthusiast, I cannot support commercial farming by ordering that, sorry. As a result, I ordered fish, which I realize is a \"no-no\" at a Steakhouse. Under the circumstances (I was actually grossed out), I felt no other choice, and let's say I won't be ordering that again. The frites, which I did try, where totally not the way I imagined them to be, as they were a weird shape and not delicately fried like I hoped. Our starter was OK...the warm brie, but since I'm not a fan of hazelnuts, I wouldn't order that again, either.\nI hope I'm not insulting anyone in saying that you would only like this place if you're used to eating mediocre quality food. If you buy Organic produce and Grass-fed meat and hit the farmer's market for seasonal, fresh food, don't bother."

It came with 6 pieces of escargots and we used the bread to dip with the remaining of the sauce, delicious!

Even sharing it, i still couldn't finish my half, so I pulled out the meat and ate that instead of all the bread. \nThe steak frites that came with it was my fave part of this dish. The most intriguing part was that it was like a cross between a fry and a potatoe chip. \nThe rest of the girls got their own individual plates, and said that was too much food for one person, so I might recommend sharing a plate. \nWe sat outside in the patio and there was a wonderful breeze, fun for people watching and you get a great view of the Bellagio water fountains from across the street.

Really great patio seating and views of Bellagio's Fountains during dinner. I had the trout amandine (trout, almond slices, preserved lemon, French haricot vert green beans) for my main entree, the crusty bread was pretty good too. Others at the table went for the steak frites with different sauces, the seared scallops, and one end of the table split an appetizer. I'm glad I received a fairly large piece of fish; the seared scallops only came with four scallops total for the price. The steaks were generous but I didn't feel like red meat that night. Didn't opt for any dessert since we had to get to Drais by a certain time."

Their restaurant is nicely designed because although we were inside, we weren't really inside because the cafe portion is open air leading out to the patio. I really enjoyed the luxury of both the air conditioning and  outdoor seating. \n\nTheir menu had a good selection, but not many options. For my entree I chose the chicken, mushroom, and kale crepe. I imagined my entree to be a dinky crepe, but I was very wrong! The crepe was huge and delicious! \n\nI'm giving Mon Ami Gabi 3 stars because it is good, but not amazing. I would come back again."

I am not sure why they ask how we wanted our steaks cooked as they are so thin you couldn't possible get a rare steak.

Mon Ami is situated right in front of the Eiffel tower, overlooking the water show at the Bellagio, with outdoor seating for those who love to people watch. \n\nDuring the summer nights, I would definitely recommend sitting outside and enjoying the warm breeze while you enjoy their delicious food.  Seriously, this is the perfect dinner spot. It's like a show and dinner type of dining experience.  There's always something interesting happening on the streets of Las Vegas that you're almost guaranteed to see something worth talking about over dinner.  Think you might run out of things to talk about during your dinner date in Las Vegas?  Bring your date here.\n\nOn my recent trip to Las Vegas over this weekend, I ordered the jumbo crab cakes and the salmon and spinach salad. The salad was absolutely delicious!  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the dressing was mild and good.  The crab cakes were average.  Definitely not the best I've had and I definitely wouldn't order it again. \n\nDespite the crab cakes, my previous experiences have been good so I would probably go back on my next visit."

We were passed off to the girl to seat us and she took us to the little greenroom/sunroom area which was was like a freaking sauna.

Mind you, there is indoor seating, with people sitting indoors, and in the shade. I completely lost it - they had already asked my seating preference at the hostess stand, I had asked for indoor seating - she said sure and took proceeded to take me OUTSIDE.  I just sat because if I opened my mouth any further we were going to have problems. Our waiter approached, took our drink order and we asked for Sweet N Low - and were told that they don't have any - who doesn't have Sweet N Low??!! We, ultimately decided to just leave.

I ordered Quiche Lorraine (French Restaurant, right? Should be good). It was about 30 seconds from being burnt. It was so \"well-done\" the eggs were dried out.

He sent it back and ordered a hamburger, specified NO RAW ONIONS! It was cooked to order but raw onion on it and NO CONDIMENTS! The waiter dropped it and ran. Never came back to check on us.

Sadly the next steak was just as poor in quality despite being seasoned, well seared and cooked to the right temperature. The manager eventually appeared and apologized as you would expect.

I am a huge fan of kir royales and eggs Benedict for brunch. It's practically impossible to get an real kir royale (made with creme de cassis) in Hawaii, so of course I had to order it when I saw it on the menu at Mon Ami Gabi. It was perfection. I also ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which was amazing. Hollandaise sauce was creamy and rich but not salty. (If I could put hollandaise sauce on everything I would) The English muffin was a tad on the chewy side but no complaints from me. My friend had the strawberry waffles which she liked, and the portion size was perfect. We weren't too stuffed but felt satisfied."

  "text" : "Review for Saturday Dinner.\n\nAs a girl who lived in France for half a year, I had a lot of expectations for this restaurant, which were met but not exceeded. \n\nThe restaurant has two seating areas, one inside - which is very reminiscent of restaurants in Paris, and the other is an inddor/outdoor patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which was really nice planning on their part. The ambiance was really nice and the dim lighting gave the restaurant a very romantic feel.\n\nNow onto the food. Like I said, I lived in France for little while so I was both really excited and really nervous to try this place - excited because I love and miss authentic French cuisine and nervous because I know what many dishes are supposed to taste like. The waiter gives each table a fresh baguette in a paper bag along with creamy butter and carrots, all of which tasted just as I remembered while I was living abroad. \n\nFor our appetizers we had the warm brie and the escargot, both of which were delicious! The only criticism that I have was that the escargot was already out of the shell, but I am pretty understanding as to why that was. For escargot newbies, dip the bread in the garlic and butter sauce for an excellent and flavorful bite! We paired these dishes with the COTES DU PROVENCE (Le Provencal), a rose from the southern part of France (which is known for their rose), and it was great.\n\nFor my main course I had the Chicken Grandmere (or grandma's chicken) which was very simple, but tasty. \n\nI would definitely come here again, but maybe for breakfast."

  "text" : "We had our wedding reception in the Cafe Halle room (private dining room) at Mon Ami Gabi this past Saturday (9/27). They did such a great job. I was worried about how it would turn out considering it was a destination wedding.  The communication between our event planner, Dusty, was exceptional.  Every time I wrote her an email or called her she replied or answered within an hour or so.  The food was delicious!  We had our guests choose between the filet, salmon, or chicken and one of my guests (who is a professional chef) said it was the best wedding reception food he had ever had. They were able to set up a projector so we could do a slide show.  They also included a bottle of champagne for my husband and I to enjoy after the event.  The room was a good size for our group (we had 25 guests).  It is too small for dancing or live music, so if that is important to you this place may not work.  We chose to have a luncheon reception at 3pm versus having a dinner for two main reasons.  First off, the luncheon food and beverage minimum is half that of the dinner minimum.  Second, 3pm vegas time is dinner time on the East coast (which is where most of our guests came from).  We were able to customize our menu and select dinner entrees instead of lunch entrees.  Pricing was very fair and accurate.   We were very happy with how everything turned out and I would not hesitate to recommend them as an exceptionally excellent venue for a smaller (less than 30 guests) wedding reception!"

  "text" : "Before hitting the road to return home, my family and I decided to have our final Vegas meal here at Mon Ami Gabi.  It was an adorable french style restaruant with an outside dining area that was identical to the parisian sidewalk cafes.  It was packed so we ended up sitting inside, which worked out well since we were hungry and had no time to waste waiting on an outdoor table.  The menu had a couple of different items that looked appetizing, such as salads and sandwiches, but I decided to order the Quiche Lorraine.  When the food came out, my quiche looked fluffy and delicious. It tasted great and I had no complaints, but my sister was a different story.\n\nMy sister ordered the same thing as me, only her quiche was flat and over cooked.  When she cut it open the inside looked nothing like my fluffy, yellow, perfectly cooked pie.  She ended up sending it back and ordering another one, which was much better but still not quite on par with mine.  Aside from the quiche issue and the fact that it took a while tor our food to be delivered, we enjoyed our time there."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi was one of the only places on my list of \"must do\" restaurants in Vegas. We ended up getting up quite early and I wanted a good, quality, tasty breakfast that wasn't going to be served in its wrapper. We got a cab down to the strip and headed to Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nThis place is attached to Paris so of course it has the requisite french theme. Service was prompt and we were seated on the already pretty full patio. It was nice to be able to sit and people watch as we had our breakfast. This is one of those places where the waiters are dressed impeccably, there are white tablecloths and napkins, and condiments are brought to you in their own tiny dishes, instead of bottles, etc. Lovely experience.\n\nI ordered the mushroom omelette, which had brie cheese on the inside and came with super crispy hash brown strings, and a piece of brioche with cream cheese and jam on the side. Everything was perfect - the omelette was INCREDIBLE. I can't say I've ever enjoyed something for breakfast that much. Melty, oozy brie cheese inside the omelette.... man, mouth is watering just thinking about it. The crispy hash browns were great, but my boyfriend would have preferred his less crispy (he's nuts, crispy hash browns all the way). I had a glass of juice and a tea and both were very good. Our meal wasn't rushed, the servers weren't all over us. It was very much so as though we were dining on our own, which was a nice way to start the day.\n\nOverall, this was an incredible meal and I wish we'd come here at least one other time to try some of the lunch or dinner options. This is a must for me the next time I go to Vegas and it should be on your list too."

  "text" : "I know what you're thinking 5 stars for a semi chain restaurant. Its unusual, but hear me out. \nI came here as part of a fairly large group that had made reservations. This was a work dinner and since everyone on the team is in different parts of the country, this was basically one of the few times we'd get to see one another. Needless to say, this led to quite a bit of moving around, seat changing and just general rowdiness on the part of our group. Our server could not have been any better. She had one of those incredible memories. All of our dishes came out at the appropriate temperature and all at the same time and were served to the correct people. This is quite a feat when you have a party of 20 people and the rest of the restaurant is packed. \nI opted for the half order of mussels, some frites and a glass of rose . My mussels were cooked exactly how I like them. The white wine/shallot sauce was divine. I could've imbibed it as a cocktail. My only complaint is that i was served a couple of mussels that still had some of the beard left. I know how hard they are to clean, so I'll let it slide. The frites were the yummy, thin, Parisian kind. My boss was sitting across from me and he had steak and frites. When i looked up from my plate, he was nearly done with his. \nThe menu included things for the pickiest of eater and we were served with a great attitude and smile. Those things cannot usually be said about most restaurants in Paris.  We all left with full bellies, empty plates and smiles on our faces. Overall a successful evening."

The Paris was relatively close to our hotel, saw the strip-side seating of the Mon Ami Gabi and thought it looked about as good as any other place.\n\nService started out a little slow.  We were seated, and then waited a bit longer than expected for the server to come by.  However, our meal made up for this minor issue, as everything we both ate was very delicious.\n\nThe free crusty bread was amazing.  Could possibly have something to do with the fact we were starving, but the bread, quite literally, was the best thing we'd ever eaten.  Okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.\n\nI decided to order the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe topped with kale and brie.  A very hearty portion, and super satisfying.  The flavor was reminiscent of the very best comfort food you can imagine.  A pure pleasure to eat.  Everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.\n\nMy husband got the Classique Steak Frites with maitre d' butter.  His hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  We've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  But these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.\n\nI recommend Mon Ami Gabi with two thumbs up.  I'd have no reservations about eating here again one day.  Was a great start to our last Vegas trip, for sure."

The lobster wasn't the best. Oysters were a major disappointment too. \n\nMay return and try something different, but the other main dishes our friends ordered weren't much to write home about either.\n\nI've heard they have amazing breakfast - would try that."

Thumbs up to servers maneuvering between the tight space. Nice place to people watch, but not exactly romantic until sun goes down and Bellagio fountain light up, people start to migrate into clubs and casino. Food is divine, service attentive, price affordable, comfortable atmosphere.. First time I tried stingray, fantastic. Deliciously seasoned salmon. Luv their cappuccino.

We had the oatmeal, scrambled eggs and bacon, and fresh fruit. I would avoid the fresh fruit as it's a lot of melon, kind of like a continental breakfast fresh fruit.\n\nThe oatmeal is steel cut and well made. We asked them to put apples and bananas in the oatmeal. All in all, I'd like to come here when I'm not watching what I eat and order their crepes or waffles or some other dish that is more French inspired than oats.\n\nI would definitely come back and given them another shot.

The ladies who I was dining with are all extraneous about their figure, but they wanted still to enjoy a wonderful meal. First my best friend ordered her food and she wanted her meal to be cooked without oil. I was thinking, ok here we go, some complicated orders... The other two ladies told the server that they would order one filet and wanted to split it, and one wanted hers cooked medium and the other wanted hers medium well, and also cooked without oil. By this time I was hanging my head in shame and became nervous that the server would protest in some way. He said, \"that's the best idea I've ever heard, excellent choice.\" He made us, especially the ladies, feel like they were on top of the world, and that we smelled like a bouquet of roses. \n\nI returned a year or 2 later, but to the restaurant upstairs. After the server took my order, all of the sudden, by the way I was feeling, I recognised the sensation. Again, I was at the top of the world, I was the best customer ever, and I smelled like roses. Impeccable, outstanding service from both Paris Hotel restaurants."

I spoke with a manager there, and it turned out he was from my state(I live in Illinois, but happened to be visiting for the weekend), and took the time to ask me not only about my experience, but about my trip, my overall feel of the city, if I'd intended on visiting that restaurant again, and thanked me for stopping in. The man behind the bar, and I feel awful for not getting his name, he treated me like a true VIP. I ordered a Unique drink, one which many establishments might not offer, but they had it and it really \"lifted my spirits\" :^) \nIn closing, I'm glad I chose this joint.

The reason is that not all tables have covering and when sunny in Vegas, it just beats down on you.  The hostess can not guarantee if there is covering for you or not.  Our reservation was 11:30 am and we sat on the patio.  The sun was beaming on me and by time we ended, I was sweating.  Service was alittle slow and when I got my food, I just wanted to eat it so fast and go cuz who wants to eat when sweating.   I got the croque monseir and the cheese on it was melting in the sun so bad.  Granted in October the heat was not as bad as it would be in the summer, so I don't know how anyone would eat out there in the summer.  We also shared a salad with shaved asparagus and thought it was ok.  Thought the price did not justify the portion or taste.  \n\nI do like the bread they gave us while seated.

  "text" : "Having lived in France and visited numerous times, I would say Mon Ami Gabi is a French bistro style restaurant.  Bistros have limited menu choices, the items are usually simple, and the service tends to be quick and efficient.  The food here is decent, although a bit inconsistent at times.  But the service was anything but quick or efficient.  After we sat down it took a long time for them to take our order.  Once our orders were taken, it was 30 minutes before our country pate arrived, a dish that requires minimal preparation.  It was another long wait before our main dishes came.  My steak frites was generously portioned, cooked to my liking, and very flavorful.  My gf's seared scallops though were overly charred, and left a burned taste in our mouths.  \n\nNow despite the slow service, and the mishap on the food, here's why I'm giving them 4 stars --- the staff and management really took care of us.  When I made a complaint to my waiter about the scallops.  He had it replaced quickly.  Then the manager came out to apologize personally, and comp'ed the appetizers and the glass of wine.  I think that kind of attention and care to your customers is very rare these days, especially from a big and busy restaurant on the strip.  So I think they deserve a compliment for that!"

Great views (from the patio).\n\nThe hostess had an attitude (if I was a manager and saw this I'd fire her) we were told the wait for outdoor patio seating was about 30-45 minutes and that we could not take the buzzer very far.  We ended up waiting about 15 minutes and played some of the machines, why they don't have more seating for guests to wait is beyond me.\n\nWe were seated one row back from the edge of where the patio meets the strip, I asked if  we could sit at a table that was clearly open along the railing and the hostess moved us over there right away.\n\nOur sever, Emily, was PHENOMENAL.  One of the best servers I've encountered in Vegas.  She recommended a great seafood appetizer (mussels), a tasty brunch item (corned beef hash) and delicious mimosas.  All of the food was tasty!  My only con is that it did seem to take a bit longer than normal to finally receive out entrees, but the flavor made up for it!\n\nThe entire time we had a front row view to the Bellagio water fountain show just across the strip.  It was also a prime spot to people watch, which in Vegas it gets VERY interesting.  BE WARNED that on the patio it does get a bit warm sitting in the sun, even in October.  They do have umbrellas to provide shade, but as the sun moves you begin to have no control over the shade as there is really no room to move the umbrellas.\n\nAll in all my girlfriend and I had a great experience and we will be going back again in the future!"

The thin cut fries are also rave worthy, especially once they get lathered in that great red wine sauce. Yum. They are crispy though before the lathering, don't worry.\nFor dessert, the chocolate mouse is excellent, with little chocolate crisps thrown in for texture. However, my favorite is their profiteroles. I believe their vanilla ice cream is home made, and if it isn't they must source the best damn ice cream company around.

  "text" : "I'm sure my rating won't contribute much to the huge pool of reviews this fancy pants French bistro has amassed over the years...but I don't give a French. \n\nI came for lunch, although I intended to drop by in the evening because everyone raves about the spectacular views of the Bellagio Fountains show across the street. However, time did not permit so I decided that I would come for the food, not the views. Don't get me wrong, if you sit in the patio during the daytime, there is still plenty of pretty scenery for you. It's just easy to imagine how much better the views are during the night. \n\nAnyway, onto the food! My partner and I opted for two sandwiches: Maine Lobster Roll and the Sandwich Du Jour (sandwich of the day). Quick tip: warm sandwiches are served with Mon Ami Gabi's renowned hand-cut frites, while cold sandwiches are served with gaufrette potato chips (AKA waffle fries). These are less acclaimed but still great.\n\nThe Maine Lobster Roll is served on a toasted brioche roll, accompanied with a side of red cabbage salad. If y'all did your research, you would know that Maine (and Northern New England) generally serves their lobster meat cold. Thus, our lobster roll was served with the gaufrette potato chips. I was expecting the hand-cut frites. It's no biggie though because I'm an equal opportunity fried potatoes consumer. These waffle fries were crisp and tasty. I didn't like the lobster roll because it was too buttery and rich for me but my boyfriend had no trouble devouring it. The roll was also smaller than I expected--hence, less lobster meat than what I anticipated. \n\nOur Sandwich Du Jour, on the other hand, was sensational! It was a seared ahi tuna sandwich served on a baguette with hand-cut frites. The ahi tuna was delicately seared on the outside, and left rare in the middle. It had a velvety texture. The mayo sauce contained a bit of zest and a lot of flavor. The baguette was hard but also packed a crunch. Now to the famous frites! I understand why they're famous: perfectly thin-cut slivers of potatoes and lightly seasoned with salt. These babies were fried to a beautiful golden brown. \n\nThe patio seats are highly touted so the restaurant doesn't accept reservations for outdoor seating; they're on a first-come, first-served basis. Yes, the views are lovely but don't forget about the dishes! It's definitely one of the best meals I've had in Vegas. Service was all right. Prices are on the higher end but totally worth it--whether you're there for the view or the food."

The outside seating provides an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains that cannot be matched. I had a pasta from here the last time I went, and I have yet to stop raving about it. It was the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Never have I tasted something so scrumptious and such a genuine flavor that I have never tasted before. The servers are always very effective and helpful. Even with the extreme amount of people, the service is grade A. I was amazed with my experience here."

My chicken, mushrooms, kale and brie crepe was fabulous, those ingredients blended well together and the hollandaise sauce was not overbearing.  A carafe of the delicious and bunchy (yep, I make up words) St. Germain cocktail is the way to go.\n\nVenue Tips: If you go, try to get a spot on the patio before the hour strikes 2 pm, for a nice showing of the Bellagio fountains in action (the fountains start their thing beginning 2 pm, on the hour and through the evening).  Warning there is scant shade on the patio and you may be in full sun, so bring your sunscreen."

  "text" : "Such a cute restaurant on the strip!\n\nA friend recommended that I visit this place, and I'm glad I did. If you're not picky about where you sit (patio vs inside), I highly suggest making a reservation. My boyfriend and I had reservations at 6pm on a Friday night, and it was already pretty busy. There was a couple in front of us without reservations, and they had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got lucky, and we were seated by the window that looks out to the Bellagio fountains. It was a very romantic, intimate setting with only candlelights lighting the restaurant. \n\nWe both ordered steak frites: the Bordelaise (carmelized onion & red wine sauce), and the Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction). Both were very good, but Filet Mignon Merlot was our favorite. The frites were more like crispy potato chips than fries, but they were very good. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the profiteroles. The portion was HUGE. Between two people we could only eat about 2/3 of it. The pastry was a bit dry to me, so I wouldn't recommend this particular dessert. \n\nOverall, great food and service in a romantic setting. Worth the visit here if you want to wine and dine in Las Vegas."

  "text" : "Located at the Paris hotel and casino.  We dropped in for a very late dinner.  This is a French bistro. When you enter from the Strip, it's to the left.  Inside the casino, it's called Mon Ami steakhouse.  That should have been a big clue.\n\nAs it was late I wanted to eat light.  I ordered the sea scallops.  Big mistake.  It came and right away I could smell how fishy it was.  Means not very fresh!  Hubby ordered the wild boar with little rags of pasta.   We traded with each other as I didn't want to risk getting ill.  At this point it's like 10:30pm.  I didn't want to wait for another entree. \n\nOur friend ordered the hangar steak.  A winner.  Her hubby got the wild boar too.  Yuck. Chunks of wild boar with doughy pasta that stuck together.   Shouldn't the boar meat be shredded?\n\nThey also got the Cesar salad and the French onion soup,   They enjoyed both.\n\nI got the house merlot.  Very good.  And they served a hot baguette in a paper bag.  Like a French bakery. Excellent bread.\n\nBottomline - I enjoyed my glass of wine and the bread. \n\nOur server Girard was funny too."

  "text" : "Came here for breakfast, this is not their strong suit. The only reason I'm not giving 2 stars is because we sat outside on the patio, and the view of the Bellagio fountains and nice day made it much more enjoyable.\n\nFirst off, their coffee is $4 each, but right when you sit they start pouring. I knew they charged, but I feel like they should ASK the customer if they would like to purchase the coffee rather than just pour it and charge you. \n\nWe got mostly omelette and one french toast to share. The omelettes were just average. For a French place I expected better. When I was in Paris, we had eggs and omlettes at a random cafe and they were cooked perfectly, I expect the same of Mon Ami when you're paying $13 for basically a few eggs. I got the turkey and egg white one. The turkey was flavorless and dry, the egg whites were dry, the avocado and tomato relish on top was forgetable. The french toast was just OK, I could probably make it at home. \n\nBasically, nothing stood out here except the ambiance and view. I MIGHT conisder coming back for lunch or dinner but with so many other, better options in Vegas that's probably not going to happen."

We made a reservation, (recommended), showed up a little early but we still got seated right away. \n\nAll the tables in this place and they put us at a little table tucked in the corner right by the windows of the patio and in direct sunlight! Thank goodness it wasn't too warm, but did have a lot of glare!\n\nWe ordered a couple of apps, the warm brie cheese, black pepper honey hazlenuts and croutons, and the jumbo crabcake with citron butter. The berie cheese was super warm, gouy and very good, a few cloves of roasted garlic, soft hazlenuts so good! The crab cake was very fresh, crab rich and the butter with a splash of acid in the lemon was right up there on the elite list of ceab cakes. Definetly recommend both apps!\n\nI also love french onion soup and ordered a bowl, it was cheesy and rich in beef broth, plenty of onions could have used just a bit more baguette, but overall very good.\n\nFor the main event we both got the steak and frites, basically a very thin steak with some thinly cut fries. It was delicious but nothing more then just steak and fries. \n\nFinally we had the white chocolate bread pudding, not that good, dry needed the ice cream and the chocolate cake, at least it was warm and very moist smoothered in two types of sauces and walnut sprinkles. \n\nVery good service food was overall good, wouldn't mind trying their breakfast!"

  "text" : "I've reviewed this before and I've been here right times.  I won't go back and I will stop recommending this place.  For many reasons.  \n\nThey charge 18% gratuity on parties of 5 or more.  We were six and the service was horrible.  She saw us twice. Once for order and once to give us the check.  No refills. No checking. Nothing.   We were going to tip 10% and to our amazement it was mandatory 18%.  I called the manager.  He came over and I told him the issue and to remove the 18%. Instead of apologizing, he put the blame back on us and said we should have asked for him.  Bottom line - we were blamed by the manager and the blame is put back on us. It shows issues not just by staff but by management. I said no and we would just walk out. He reluctantly removed the 18% and dropped the check back on our table. NO APOLOGY.  \n\nThe steak was overcooked for most of us. The mean was so so this time.  Its just a disappointment and there are tons of other options so I highly recommend if you are a party of 5 or more - be careful.  \n\nThe place is very dark too - hard to read menus and the chairs are wicker and uncomfortable- mostly to make the tables turn quicker.   It's obviously about the money there rather than service.  Go elsewhere.\n\nI got the impression she was mad they sat a party of 6 at an 8 table.  We didn't want wine because we already drank and I thought she felt we weren't a big value table.  So figured she got 18% automatically and that was enough.  It wasn't crowded.  Amazed she never checked with us.   For a restaurant to make 18% mandatory for 5 or more shows they have service issues.   Usually it's 6 or 8."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is a French bistro located in the Paris Hotel.  I went on the recommendation of a friend who claims it as his favorite Las Vegas restaurant, as well as largely positive Yelp! reviews.  \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is dark and dim, with walls loaded with various French-inspired memorabilia.  In any event, I'd suggest sitting outside, which provides prime people-watching territory on the strip.\n\nThe bulk of the menu consists of simple bistro classics like mussels and steak frites.  I had steak frites; my flat-iron steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare, as ordered.  Entrees come with a choice of sauce.  I ordered bearnaise, and it was perfect.  I had the privilege of sampling the food of my dining companions, and enjoyed it as much as they did.  One of them ordered a bowl of mussels in buttery, herbaceous white wine broth, and the other ordered a NY-strip with butternut squash puree and bordelaise sauce.  As I said, each item was properly prepared and delicious.\n\nOur waitress was polite and fairly attentive, considering that the restaurant was fairly busy during our dinner.  My only real complaint about the meal was the \"frites\" component of my steak frites.  I found them to be too thin, a bit dry, and cold.  Maybe they were pre-cooking large batches far ahead of time in reaction to the large number of customers.  That would be unfortunate.\n\nOverall, however, the positives far outweighed the negatives of my visit.  Mon Ami Gabi is a damn good place to get a steak in a great, casual environment, at a far lower price than a traditional American steakhouse."

  "text" : "I have not been to Mon Ami Gabi for about 10 years.  I don't remember it being too great, but I thought I would give it another try last week.  I was traveling in Vegas for work, and having dinner solo that evening.  I went in around 8:30pm and sat at the bar.  The first thing I noticed was the numerous servers standing around, and just chatting with each other.  They were definitely overstaffed.\n\nI got the bartenders attention, and ordered a glass of Bordeaux.  I was bothered that she served it to me in a small white wine glass.  I noticed that other patrons were served in Bordeaux glasses, but she elected to just quickly give it to me.  She even opened a new bottle, and did no offer me a taste.\n\nThis was basically how the entire meal went for me.  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and she definitely gave the attention to an older gentleman wearing a suit at the end of the bar. I usually don't weigh service as an issue at restaurants, but I do take offense when I am ignored for wearing a t-shirt, or if nobody says goodbye to me when i leave.  I definitely had an experience with both of these at the restaurant.\n\nTo eatm I had the filet and a side salad.  Both were mediocre, and nothing fantastic.  If I was rating the food alone, this would be a 3 star dinner.  However, the service clearly makes me drop Mon Ami down by at least a star.  In my opinion, for the price, 2 stars is very generous.  I suggest passing and trying another french bistro (Bouchon or DB Brasserie)."

My husband had mussels and oysters that were yummy too. \nThe only this I didn't like is that they serve their wine in small wine glasses and they fill it up more that half a glass so you can't even swirl the wine.\nWill definitely recommend this place."

We arrived around brunch time when the traffic really picked up. The patio wait list was 45-60 min so we opted for indoor dining instead. We were sat right away towards the strip so we had the gorgeous view of the Bellagio. I ordered the  Bordelaise Steak Frite and my mom ordered the Chicken Paillard. Each of us ordered a glass of Pinot Merlot. I must say, my steak was close to, if not being, the best steak I've ever had. My mothers dish was exceptionally delicious as well. We asked one of the staff, Richard Uzi, to take a picture of us. One of the most humbling and friendly people. His character really brought our dining experience to the next level. Will definitely return here and recommend this place to friends."

  "text" : "Came here for thanksgiving dinner. Gotta say everything was pretty delicious.....except for the turkey.  We got lucky and there was patio seating available which gave us a perfect view of the bellagio fountains.  It's kinda funny to think that a main draw of this restaurant is based off of its view of a competing hotel.  The endive salad was really good, but the smoked salmon was amazing. Kinda wish I had double of that instead of my turkey. I simply cannot dock this restaurant because I thought their white meat of their turkey was exceptionally dry.  Any other day of the year I would never order turkey.  Lastly, I had pumpkin bread pudding. I usually don't love bread pudding, it's more of my gf's thing, but this time it was amazing. So rich and moist. Too bad it's probably a seasonal item.  I'll likely be back, next time to try a steak or something."

I was here before I eloped with my hubby and Elvis walked me down the aisle.  A lot of major milestones in life was spent here.\n\nThe wait here isn't bad but definitely make a reservation.  They seat you within 5 min of your arrival if you make a reservation.  The service here is always immaculate.  Food is always amazing.  The french bread they serve is always the right amount of soft on the inside and crusty on the outside.   I always get the steak and pomme frites.  They offer it with different kinds of sauces so there's always something new to try even if you're mostly a carnivore like me.  Love love love this place.  I always eat here when I'm in Vegas."

The plates and cups on the table were dusty and a little grimey. The food was not as tasty as previous visits. I have never been totally in love with the food, but it was always decent and the location and price point made it that much better. \n\nThe lobster roll was overly creamy and mayonnaise-y and the croque Monsieur was ok and probably the best dish of the meal. Our dining companion found a hair in their salad and it took a long time to get our server's attention to get that fixed. After that her replacement dish was slow to arrive. \n\nIt was a busy Sunday, so I understand that they were slower than usual but that didn't explain the dusty plates and glasses. \n\nIt's still a decent restaurant to visit to enoy the patio and view of the fountains, the food just isn't as good as it used to be."

Our waiter was French which also added to the experience. He was very kind - but he forgot part of our order and he forgot that we had even ordered it when we asked him about it. We had the escargot and the steak and frites. The frites were done perfectly, and the steak was cooked just as I ordered. It's difficult to get such a thin slice of steak to be cooked medium, but they did it. I had their house Pinot Noir, but I was not impressed with it. The escargot was the perfect amount of softness and chewiness and it was drowned in herbed butter just as it should have been. The loaf of bread that comes complimentary definitely helped me enjoy the butter even more. \n\nOne thing I found odd was that they served a cole slaw with their complimentary bread. I have not seen that done in French restaurants before. It had a very nice flavor - very fresh. It seemed out of place, but we did eat it all."

I would have given this 5 stars but I was turned off by the fact that you cannot reserve the patio. IMO you should be be able to reserve at least part of it and then leave the rest as first come first serve. The service is not that great and I am not a diva by any means. We ordered the Mussels and the plate came out with the sauce under the bowl so it dripped all over the table and our waitress did nothing about it. The server saw it and he finally covered it with a cloth. Between appetizers and our main course our waitress did not clear the table and I started to place our dishes on the table next to us to make room. When she saw this she rushed over and said, \"No this table is clean.\" I wish mine was too! lol. Aside from that great place don't expect the same quality service as the food though."

You simply can't beat the location and view of this restaurant, right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The food is pretty good, not cheap, but not too expensive either.  Definitely not your typical snooty upscale Vegas dining.  The portions are reasonably sized and priced ($20-$30), with steak, seafood, and even a few pasta options.  I had the steak frite, medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly, relatively tender (it's not a filet, but wasn't bad), and seasoned well.  The dinner and selections worked out really well for both the grandparents and kids.  Very versatile.\nPositives: Excellent location and view of the Bellagio fountains.  Recommend eating on the patio (no reservations accepted, supposedly).\nNegatives: The wait for patio can be long....we were told about 15-30 minutes, ended up taking 45-60 minutes to get a table.

During our most recent visit, my husband and I shared the frisée, kale, and warm bacon salad with a soft-poached egg, he ordered the cinnamon pancake, which was a large crepe with a side of blueberries (brunch was over but they accommodated him anyhow), and I had the seafood crepe. Their crepe batters are perfect, never chewy, and so delicately thin. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!"

My friend and I split a quiche and their pomegranate and pineapple pancake--both of which were extremely filling and delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy, and the onions, bacon, and herbs complimented each other well. The pancake turned out to be more like a crepe and was not overly sweet.  My favorite part of the meal was the pineapples which were sautéed in what tasted like brown butter.  The service was excellent and we didn't have to wait long for a table.\nI'd come here again for brunch."

Okay, done with the dang potatoes!  \n\nWe also ordered the baked scallops gratineés, a side of date-glazed, thick-cut bacon as well as cappuccinos (which were very small in quantity, but good).

If you are going to feed birds at a restaurant (which you shouldn't), at least throw the bread crumbs around your own table. \n\nThere are a couple of these around Chicago, so we probably could have skipped this place."

I highly recommend the New York Strip with the Roquefort sauce. Mouth-watering. The bread pudding, roasted chicken, and spinach side were similarly excellent.\n\nSo good is Mon Ami Gabi that I would put it way, way, way ahead of Gordon Ramsay steak. I love Gordon Ramsay, but our experience there was overpriced and not at all up to the standards I've seen Ramsay scream at people for not having when they're in front of a television camera. If you want steak, Mon Ami Gabi is no slouch and you're going to have just as satisfying of a meal for a bit less money.\n\nOnly complaint: my steak was supposed to be cooked medium, and I found it to be a little over, as did most of the meat-eaters at the table. Still, the outstanding flavors made up for it and I stopped thinking about it largely after the first bite."

We were seated and told as soon as the rest of our party arrived to basically hurry up and order. The seafood tower was not good the waiter forgot my husbands soup brought our food it was cold when he took it back he acted as if he was doing us a favor because now my husband would have time to eat his soup the worst was we got our food the 2nd time it was still cold and the rest of our party was finished eating. They did take quite a large amount off our bill but my Christmas dinner ended up to be left over pizza after I got home. Disappointing"

Notwithstanding Gordon Ramsay Steak, and perhaps The Bacchanal at Caesars Palace but that's a buffet and in a different league altogether. (I'll save that for another review) Not to mention these are really very reasonable prices on the Strip.\n\nWe came for breakfast, rather early at 7am, since we were up at 5am due to the most horrendous jet-lag having traveled all the way from Minneapolis. Coffee and provisions were desperately needed. We got seated on the patio by request, with a view overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio. I was on my summer vacation and ready to enjoy myself thoroughly. My Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was spot on. Rich hollandaise sauce covered the English muffins and it was truly a remarkable experience. I am a huge fan of the coffee. (Intelligentsia coffee, I believe) It was rich, strong and flavorful. It revived us perfectly. We also shared their Blueberry Pineapple Crepes, special of the day. Came with a little boat of freshly whipped cream. They were light, sweet and scrumptious. Good for sharing. \n\nFor an impromptu, spur of the moment breakfast idea, this place was a 10 out of 10. Service was exemplary, waters were promptly refilled, and the restrooms are located out of the restaurant and inside the Paris casino. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and very French, in keeping with the theme of the hotel. They have nightly dinner specials. I think I saw Beef Wellington on the Sunday menu. In case you wanted to give that a try instead of Gordon's Beef Welly across the slot machines. His food is pretty spectacular too though, so have a go at it. Every time we go to Vegas, we'll make Mon Ami Gabi a regular breakfast spot."

We had a comped night at Bally's, and I've been meaning to try Mon Ami Gabi since moving here 2.5 years ago.  Unfortunately, we didn't have the great experience that I've heard many other people rave about.\n\nFirst, the positives...our seat out on the patio overlooking the Strip had an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains.  Even as locals, we enjoyed this view.  Our server was fantastic, very engaging, and had great knowledge of the menu.  He also recommended the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer, which was absolutely delicious.\n\nWe both ordered Steak Frites, which unfortunately did not live up to expectations.  My girlfriend ordered the Hanger Steak, and we both agreed that it was tough.  Not just a little tough, but really just not edible.  Our server and the manager did the right thing and replaced it with a filet mignon at no additional charge, which was delicous.  I got the signature steak - the sirloin.  The sirloin was thinner on the edges and thicker in the middle.  The edges were delicious, but the middle was chewy and tough.  I'm not sure if the steak was poorly butchered, or should have been cooked differently, but either way, it was not well-prepared.  By that time, we had already sent one steak back, and I had eaten some of mine before realizing the problem, so I did not send mine back.\n\nNot sure if we caught the restaurant on an off day - maybe a cook called in sick, or they got an order of lower quality meat, but we did not get to have the Mon Ami Gabi experience.  We were disappointed that Mon Ami Gabi did not live up to it's reputation.  We're torn between trying it again because many locals we know love it, or checking out one of the many other steakhouses on the Strip."

  "text" : "My second visit here and it deserves a review. For starters this is a very cute Parisian place to get brunch with friends and family on the strip. Great atmosphere and service, located at the Paris Casino. I always make reservations via the Yelp app and it's the best way to reserve a spot without waiting for an hour or so. This place can get busy, so plan ahead! Do sit outside in the patio to enjoy the view of the Bellagio and the tourists walking around. Today was cold but they had heaters outside, so it was pleasant to enjoy the first day of the new year and cold winter of Vegas. I ordered cappuccino for my drink, it was delicious. Then we were served warm French baguette. My mom and I decided to go surf and turf style. We ordered the Lobster Roll sandwich. It is a cold sandwich and deliciously marinated. For our turf we ordered Prime Steak sandwich. Literally the meat melts in your mouth, and the fries on the side were yummy. Last time I tried the Classic Quiche which is phenomenal as well. The menu is not overwhelming, and experience has shown that you can order anything from the menu and you will be a happy person! Satisfaction guaranteed. Happy eating!"

  "text" : "Pleasantly surprised! Honestly, I thought this was going to be poor in quality and just paying a lot at a fancy place to be facing the strip. The menu looks ordinary, but everything I had was really good.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Wowed by the food. The breakfast potatoes are the best hash browns I have ever eaten! A bargain at $3.95, I immediately ordered another one even though my meal came with one. It is super light and crispy on the top, unlike anything I have eaten before. Then, the bottom half is almost like a creamy mashed potatoes, rather than the usual \"crappy part of the hash brown\". We had a week of good eats on our vacation, and this item was amazingly my #1 favorite. We also had the corned beef hash and it was fantastic. I'm used to it looking like the diced mush that comes out of a can (even from restaurants), and this was amazing. Huge cubes of impressively tender meat, with grilled onions that melt in your mouth, and thin and crispy potatoes. \n\n2) Great views of the Bellagio fountain.\n\n3) No wait at 8am. Just us and maybe four other old people LOL.\n\nCons:\n\n1) The waitress didn't do anything wrong, but I just expected more from a nicer place like this. Even the greeting seemed lackluster, and although the place was almost empty, it took a long time to take care of our bill because the waitresses were just chatting with each other and not looking our way to see we needed them.\n\n2) The bread is way too hard for human teeth."

Everything tasted fine but when I went to break the last yoke, there was speckles of green. At first I thought it was pieces of chives but as I picked at it the green just bled into the yolk. I'm not saying it was mold, and from what I could taste it wasn't foul. \n\nBut what alarmed me was that when I told our waitress to take a look and just have the kitchen check their eggs in case it was mold to prevent a future complaint she just looked confused at me, didn't even look at my plate and said \"oh\" and walked away. \n\nShe never apologized or looked at my plate to confirm the green. She didn't even take my plate away to show the kitchen. I took a photo of it before the bus boy took away my plate, which tells me she probably never told the kitchen either."

I liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. Despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the Jersey Boys show, the food was excellent. After sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \n\nAfter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \n\nGuest #1 ordered a Lentil Soup and Endive and Blue Cheese Salad. The Lentil Soup (Soup of the Day) consisted of lentil and herb purée.  The Endive and Blue Cheese Salad consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\n\nGuest #2 ordered an Onion Soup Au Gratin and Trout Amandine. The French Onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. The Trout Amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. It was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. He was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \n\nGuest #3 ordered the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\n\nGuest #4 ordered Caramelized Sea Scallops which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare sea scallops caramelized in maple syrup. It was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash purée.\n\nGuest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the Skate Wing. For those of you that don't know what a Skate Wing is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. It came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. It was the most delicious dish of the night.\n\nWe finished our meal with a Creme Brûlée and a Caramelized Pineapple Crepe. The Creme Brûlée was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. The Caramelized Pineapple Crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. It was topped with caramelized pineapple  \nand drizzled with caramel sauce."

The navy beans were undercooked and almost crunchy. The raw oysters were overly fishy and tiny. The French onion soup was nothing special. The bread in it looked and tasted like wheat loaf bread. The House Vouvray was corked. The service was abrupt and uninformed. Her lack of knowledge of the menu - and French cuisine - was inexcusable. And if you are charging $25-$30 a plate, the servers should know how to pronounce what they are serving. Cocktails and desserts were good. Atmosphere is nice."

The warm bread, nice wine selection, and desserts with attentive coffee service stood out for me. As a vegetarian I didn't have many options (at a steakhouse on the strip i didn't expect to) but the side dish Brussels sprouts were incredible. The vegetable tagine was the sole vegetarian entrée option and while I enjoyed the flavors (preserved lemon with almonds, especially) i feel like it was too light to be a meal. I wish it had been a heartier tagine with chickpeas, served with rice. Everyone else at our table loved their meal including my partner who is a foodie. I would absolutely come back for the sweet ambience alone though. A great pick for a memorable family or group meal. Def get reservations and be sure to sit outside to get the full experience."

Once seated, my mother who was directly under the heat lamps was burning up to the point of discomfort and suffocation. When we requested our waiter to turn it down, he kept brushing us off mumbling he would see what he can do about it. Several minutes later we called out for another waiter and told him of the heat problem. He was frank and explained you can't turn down the heat unless you're going to turn them all down, as they're connected to 1 central switch. Immediately after, we caught our waiter watching us make the 2nd complaint. He was clearly unhappy that we made a 2nd complaint because he turned around and started snickering and talking to coworkers about us. We asked to sit at next empty table, to which he complied but sighed in exasperation. He did not even try to hide his annoyance!\n\nThe food came and everything was deep fried in tons of grease. We had waffles, eggs Benedict, and omelettes, and hashbrowns. Everything was deep fried so much so that every single 1 of us got sick after, with stomach ache, nausea, etc. \n\nLastly, when the check arrived we saw that 18% group gratuity was already added. The extra 5th person in our group was my 4 yr old who did not order anything. We walked straight to who looked like an assistant Mgr and she took off the gratuity without any questions. While she was doing it, our rude waiter was hovering over her shoulder throwing up his hands and again, not even trying to hide his absolute dislike for us. \n\nThe male server's name is Efrain. He was an absolute nightmare to be around. Maybe the stress and tension of it all was the kicker to all of our stomach aches."

Our group of 5 came here for brunch after seeing the positive reviews and surprisingly reasonably priced brunch menu. It definitely fulfilled and surpassed our expectations! My guess is that it would do well even in an urban area, without requiring the constant flow of Vegas customers to support its business.\n\nThe restaurant is quite spacious, with several rooms of tables and outdoor seating. In the last room facing the back there is also a direct view of the Bellagio Fountains, which makes a nice backdrop for enjoying the Parisian food and decor while inside the restaurant. \n\nWe shared the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer which comes with a flavorful tomato sauce and crunchy garlic bread. They also provide free, unlimited bread (A HUGE PLUS), which we used after the garlic bread was finished to continuously dip into the sauce and maximize every last drop of flavor.\n\nI had the Kale & Warm Bacon salad while others tried the Eggs Benedict and other standard brunch items.

It was nice to be inside in the warmth yet still have daylight shine through all the windows and be able to look outside.\n\nI forgot the name of our waiter but my impression of him was wrong. I assumed (sorry) that because it was a fancy place and my partner and I were a little younger than the crowd, he wouldn't serve us with effort. To our surprise again, he did. He was humorous, attentive, and friendly. When my partner accidentally dropped her knife, he noticed and offered a steak knife instead. When we he finished our plate of escargot, he said the sauce was the best part to dip the bread in (which I am glad he mentioned because I had been secretly doing so but stopped because I thought it was rude for some reason).\n\nOn to the food. The prices are actually quite affordable. $26-$27 for an amazingly thin-sliced, long portion of steak and a batch of crispy fries are worth every dime. I ordered the classic and I was more than pleased. My partner ordered the steak with caramelized onion, also tasty. The French fries had a potato chip feel to it. We also ordered mimosas and, though a little pricy in my book, they had generous amounts of champagne. The escargot appetizer was quite delicious. Smaller than I had imagined, but great to try out. There are 6 pieces (found an extra in ours) smothered in a green garlic butter sauce. If you've never tried it before, just prepare for a gummy texture and a dirt aftertaste. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. I did not mind paying the amount I did because the steak portions were amazing, one mimosa gives a nice buzz, and service from our waiter was excellent. I would definitely return here whenever I visit Vegas and highly recommend all others to visit."

It faces the Bellagio fountains and watching the tourists is fun too. Be aware if you're new to Vegas - the Bellagio fountains only 'dance' at night. But during the day it's still a lovely view. If you're looking for a place to dine with the ultimate views of the fountains eat on the terrace at Olives in Bellagio or go up to the Paris restaurant at the top of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris.\n\nI generally do lunch here, and my two favorite dishes are or the Frisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad ($11.95) or one of their Crepes ($13.95). Both are excellent and reasonably priced. Dinner is more expensive, but still fun and worth it. My husband and I have split a steak entrée - sorry can't remember which one.\n\nThe only drawback to the restaurant is it is a tight fit.

  "text" : "Came here for brunch and was seating without a problem.  The patio area seems to be the place where people want to sit, as it was almost at capacity but almost empty inside.  We chose to sit inside.  It had been a while since I'd dined here and never for brunch.  I was not disappointed.\n\nI had the best Croque Madame ($14) ever!  The bread was just so buttery with a light crunch.  The sandwich was so simple yet made really well.  The ham, which I find on the saltier side, was not salty at all!   And the egg on top (over easy) was cooked perfectly.  I definitely recommend this if you are a fan of this sandwich.  In addition, it came with their fries that I love so much.  They look like flat wonton chips and come crispy.\n\nMy friend ordered the special that morning, which was a Duck Hash.  Unfortunately, it was not as good as my sandwich.  The dish was way too salty, though certain bites seemed okay.  The bites that were not salty did taste good, so it was a shame that the salt was so overpowering in most of it.  It had a nice blend of herbs and came with homemade English muffins, which were definitely better than the store-bought kind.  I had the fresh orange juice, which tasted like it was not freshly squeezed but store bought.  I've notice many restaurants will call their OJ freshly squeezed when it comes from a carton that says \"freshly squeezed.\"  This does not count!  Not sure if Mon Ami does that, but it didn't taste fresh.  \n\nService was good, and I'd definitely order the Croque Madame again!  Prices are affordable, too."

The problem wasn't with the kitchen since other tables had no problem getting seated and finishing before we started.  The problem was with our server who, when we brought it to her attention, just said she wanted to space things out.  Fortunately, the host came by to apologize and when the food came, it was good."

The blueberry compote is hands down the best I've ever had! \n\nOn our most recent trip, we made a reservation on yelp the night before, requesting that we be sat out on the patio. With front row seats to the Bellagio's synchronized fountain show, the patio is definitely the place to be. We were disappointed to learn that they don't accept reservations for the patio, only for the dining room, which is rather cavernous. We opted to wait for a table on the patio, which only took about 5 minutes. I ordered the special - eggs benny with mushrooms and gruyere. It was very good! Nice and savory without being too overwhelming with flavor.\n\nMon ami Gabi is a must for anyone staying on the strip! I will absolutely be back on my next Vegas trip."

IMO their service and food quality have slowly swirled down the drain. \nWith my wife and eldest daughter out of town, my youngest daughter and I decided to go to Mon Ami Gabi. The last time we ate there i was unimpressed with the food or service, but brushed it off as a off night for them. Over the last year or so I've noticed that the food and service has been hit and miss.\nWe made reservations, and we were seated immediately. A staff member asked if we wanted sparkling or still water, we ordered sparking. That arrived quickly as well as the baguette & butter. \nThe first (of many) waiter soon arrived and took our drink order. Another waiter arrived after the first one left and asked us for our drink order. We told her we gave someone the drink order and she left. \nThe drinks arrived, and about 5 minutes later the second waiter retuned to take our dinner order. My daughter ordered the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad and I ordered the NY Strip (medium) and French Green Beans. \nSooner than i expected, a 3rd waiter arrived with our meal. \nI did not see the 2nd waiter, who took our order, for the rest of the meal.\nThe salmon was a bit overdone, and the steak was medium rare, edible enough to not make a fuss. \nOur meal was also served with a cloaking device, as we were not disturbed until we had finished out meals and had to flag down a busboy to find a waiter.\nThe first waiter arrived and asked if we wanted desert. \nAll I wanted was my check. I left a 12% tip.\n\n1. Our order taking waiter did not tell us about the specials\n2. food was meh\n3. service was meh\n\nI'll not be returning. \n\nWe went to Luv-It Frozen Custard for desert. That place is 5 stars."

I got the Dijon and the BF got the Béarnaise. We both got it medium rare. The wait was about 20-25 minutes for the food to come. We were served bread, butter & carrots that were grated while we waited for our food. \n\nThe service was super on point ! Our server was super helpful, friendly & very accommodating. \n\nThe food was great as well. For the Dijon steak and frites it came with Dijon butter slathered on top of the steak and the bèarnaise came with a thick but smooth cream colored sauce. The steaks were cooked on point! Super buttery & it melted in my mouth. I didn't like the fries though. They were way too salty :( so I barely touched them. The BF also didn't really touch his fries cos they were salty. Sucks because it was literally steak and fries and we couldn't enjoy the fries. :|\n\nOverall everything was good & the service was amazing. Would def come again!"

HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAKING A RESERVATION. \n\nTheir menu is brief but lots of good choices and their wine and alcohol menu had great choices as well. They start you off with large baguettes and butter also comes with this magnificent pickled beet spread. I ordered their French onion soup and warm goat cheese salad. The soup was very good but had TONS of cheese and the salad was also very good. Everyone else I was with ordered some sort of steak and all of their plates were cleaned off. \n\nThe bill came to $230 for seven people including alcoholic drinks and an appetizer. It was a great place for a group dinner and very reasonable for the price."

If a restaurant has a gluten-free menu, usually it's just a few options and doesn't include appetizers or desserts. Mon Ami Gabi has the largest gluten-free menu I've ever seen at a restaurant; they even brought me gluten-free bread so I wasn't just sitting there awkwardly watching my friends eat baugettes as we waited for our main courses. \n\nOur waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful when I ordered. He gave me a great wine recommendation and made sure my order stayed gluten-free. I ordered the scallops with brussel sprouts, which was amazing! Everyone else in my party ordered a merlot butter steak, recommended by our waiter.  I don't usually eat red meat at all, but I tried a bite of my boyfriend's filet and I could have definitely ate the whole thing! We will definitely be coming back next time we're in town!"

And every time has been a very solid dining experience without any disappointments.  If you've read all my previous updates, I have always ordered something different and the trend continues on with this review.\n\nBreakfast still continues to shine:\n\nEggs Benedict Special with Turkey and Avocado -- at Mon Ami Gabi http://bit.ly/1nnTvSY\nI've had their crab cake and standard eggs benedict before and they were great, this special was really good as well.  But like those two other dishes I've had before, their Hash Browns keep stealing the show!\n\nHam & Cheese Crepe w/ Egg -- http://bit.ly/1z8QQEF\nI had this during my last trip in December and it was first crepe at MAG.  It was delicious!  Had a good amount of ham and cheese inside and you gotta add the runny egg as it really completes the crepe even though it costs extra.\n\nDinner on the patio at night is also still one of my favorite things to do in Vegas whenever I visit:\n\nScallops Gratinees --  http://bit.ly/1z203P6\nw/ Fennel, Onion, Mussel Cream\nThis was not bad.  It's basically like a scallops version of oyster rockefeller.  Really cheesy but the scallops were a little on the small side.\n\nCassoulet --  http://bit.ly/1z20gSC\nDuck Leg & Pork Belly, Oven Dried Tomato\nMAG continues to surprise me with their take on classic french dishes.  This Cassoulet was excellent!  And loaded!  Along with the huge duck leg, it came with at least 3 generously sized pieces of pork belly.  It's a very different cassoulet than others I've had before but it still delivered.\n\nDespite being considered now one of the \"older\" restaurants on the Strip, Mon Ami Gabi still manages to stay fresh and current with their menu.  You have to dine here a least once if you're ever visiting Vegas."

Breakfast was very good...I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage and my husband had the special which was braised beef hash, which was also very good but was a relatively small portion (a definite negative for my husband!) He also had a bloody Mary which was very good (They had a bloody Mary bar as well, which looked amazing!) we enjoyed breakfast so much, we decided to go back for dinner a few nights later. Only waited for 15 mins for an outdoor table and were seated with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. They bring out  a fresh, warm baguette with butter-yum! I ordered a bowl of french onion soup - incredible. my husband ordered salmon tar tar which he said was delicious. For our meals, I got the crab cake, which was very fresh and tasty, but was only a crab cake ($17, no extras-veggies, starch, etc). My husband got the Hanger steak with fries which was excellent. we shared the banana foster crepe for dessert, also wonderful. Our waiter was excellent as well-very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  We would definitely recommend Mon Ami Gabi  and would eat here again if visiting Vegas."

We didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes, if even! \n\nService was prompt and friendly. We were greeted by our waiter almost as soon as we sat down. We ordered the warm brie, frisee salad, and classique steak frites.  The warm brie comes with 3 hard bread  slices (for spreading), roasted garlic, and hazelnuts. Roasted garlic and warm brie are two of my favorite foods, so obviously there was no room for error! The frisee salad comes with a poached egg, croutons, and a metric sh*t-ton of bacon. Not thin, wimpy bacon, either! Thick, flavorful, chewy bacon! The salad had some sort of vinaigrette that I could have lived without, but it was still a good salad! \n\nOur steak was cooked to order; medium. The cook was perfect and the fries were crunchy. There was an herb butter served on top, plenty to spread all over your steak! Your heart and hips will thank you later! \n\nI would totally visit again, especially to try their cassoulet."

  "text" : "My wife and I had a great dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi. Compared to the other restaurants in that area of the strip (and considering it's location), their prices were reasonable. We've dined at Eiffel Tower before and their prices were double than Mon Ami Gabi which was just below it. \n\nThe hostess was gracious and was precise about how much time we had to wait. We've made reservations earlier that day through Yelp using Opentable (highly suggest this for any reservations anywhere) and they saw all of our requests such as a table outside facing the strip with a heater. The weather on the night we dined was fairly mild combined with an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountain made up for a truly unforgettable dining experience. The food was superb. My wife and I both had steaks and they were cooked right down to how we requested it. We had a Large Carafe of Sangria which paired perfectly with our entree. For desert, gotta have the chocolate cake. It is superb. \n\nThe only negative about this review and the reason why I only give it for 4 stars was the waiter. He was okay but we expected more coming from a restaurant such as Mon Ami Gabi. Maybe he just had a bad day. He was not rude but his service was just plain and bland and when we asked about his opinion on which steak to order he just said, whatever you want! I think the better response would have been to explain what the different steaks were, how they were cooked and what made them special. I expected a better knowledge on the menu and explaining it to the customer rather than letting the customer figure out the menu. But overall, the experience was very nice. And for the Mon Ami Gabi management if you're reading this, re-train some of your servers so your diners will have the best dining experience. In fairness to the other servers, again, I think our server maybe just had a bad day because everyone else seemed nice."

While sitting on the balcony at our hotel looking at the strip, I spotted Mon Ami Gabi. I'd been here once about 8 years ago for dinner and enjoyed the food. I thought a nice lunch outside would be a great way to revisit.\n\n*Sauvignon blanc: saint bris, 11 ($11)\nPerfect for a nice sunny day. Crisp and light.\n\n*Jumbo crabcake: pickled celery, citron butter ($17.95)\nThis was huge! Had chunks of crab and a light beurre blanc sauce.\n\n*Onion soup au gratin: the french classic baked with gruyere cheese ($10.95)\nYum! A huge portion. The soup was full of flavor and the cheese was nice and melty. The best onion soup I've had in a while.\n\n*Frisee, kale & warm bacon salad: soft-poached egg ($11.95)\nCompared to the frisee salad we had for dinner a couple nights before, this was amazing. Exactly what I wanted from a frisee salad. The vinaigrette cut into the richness of the bacon and egg. Perfectly balanced.\n\n*Mussels mariniere: white wine & herbs ($11.95 half order)\nThe sauce was so good! I even ate some bread just so I could soak up the sauce. A nice portion for a half order and the mussels were plump and tender.\n\nSitting outside is a nice way to enjoy the sun and people watch. But beware that it can get intensely hot in the direct sunlight. They don't have umbrellas outside so you can walk away with a little more color than you bargained for.\n\nThis was a nice light lunch to bring us into our last day in Vegas. And who doesn't love a taste of Paris?!"

They apologized sincerely and were very understanding.\n\nI would definitely go back in a heart beat.

We came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes. \n\nOur table ordered Bordelaise Steak Frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); Chicken and Mushroom Crepe (with kale and brie); Seafood Crepe (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); Onion soup; and Eggs Benedict (with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce). \n\nThe steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. Steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. Onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but I can't say it stood out from other onion soups I've had. Can't speak for the chicken and mushroom crepe since I didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. The seafood crepe not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. The large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. Eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. The muffin was too hard and I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce."

  "text" : "Maybe it was because this was one of many amazing meals I had that week or maybe it was because I had one too many sangrias, but I thought this place was just okay.\n\nI am thinking that it has such high reviews because for the price you are getting everything at, you are getting a great deal. It is a higher-end, nicer sit-down meal, but it is not the best you are going to find in Vegas, nor the worst. \n\nWe started with the housemade country pate, which was excellent. We also got the warm brie cheese which was divine - I don't even like brie cheese but I found myself eating more and more of it.\n\nFor my main course, I got the beranise steak frites. It was cooked correctly, but I just did not find anything special about it. I had also had a few steaks earlier in the week that specialized in different types of steaks, so it could be that my review is skewed because of that.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is also really nothing special either. Like most restaurants in Vegas, the tables are too close together, so you feel like you are dining with the couples on either side of you. We had a reservation for 6:30pm and didn't get seated until 7pm, so that was a little off-putting as well. It was noisy, but not so loud that I couldn't carry on a conversation at the table.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to someone who is not a foodie, but is looking to have a nice sit-down meal at an affordable price for Las Vegas standards. For someone who is looking for a really good meal, I would send them elsewhere."

We were seated quickly and orders taken quickly. The baguette and butter is really good although we would've loved french cultured butter for the bread but it was still good. We had the country pate for appetizer which was a healthy portion size with onions and cornichones and toast yummy. For mains we ordered steak frites which was well cooked,a nice portion and tasty, hubby had moules which he said was very tasty with lots of sauce, og portion as well. Overall a nice experience we would return as the servers were attentive and food flavorful and plentiful for price."

We had the Warm Goat Cheese app as well and it was just as good. Excellent spot, good food and our waiter was pleasant as well.

  "text" : "A LITTLE PARISIAN ROMANCE\nGreat reviews led us to Mon Ami Gabi, a French restaurant located at the Paris Hotel, and directly across the street from the Bellagio.\n\nWhen you arrive, do not ponder whether one should dine inside, in the more formal dining area, or outside on the patio.  The outdoor patio is a MUST.  For cooler evenings, there are heating lamps evenly spaced between tables.\n\nWe arrived early for our dinner reservation.  The patio area was completely full, albeit one table.  With its prime location and Vegas crowds, I could imagine the seating full, for the entirety of any day.  We were seated along the perimeter, directly across from the Bellagio and their spectacular water fountain show.  It was, undoubtedly, the best seat in the house.\n\nA loaf of French bread wrapped in a cute paper bag, along with whipped butter and a serving of grated carrots in a vinaigrette was placed on our table.  \n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Mussels Marinière, in a delicate white wine and herb sauce.  This was simply delicious.  Once the mussels were eaten, we used the French bread as a \"plate mop\" for scooping up all that delicious broth from the bowl then into our mouths.  \n\nFor our entrées my husband ordered the Chicken Paillard.  It was served with a roasted kabocha squash and tenderly sautéed in mushrooms and lemon butter.  I ordered a 22 oz. grain fed, Midwest bone-in rib eye served with a Béarnaise sauce on the side.  My steak looked good, but average in taste and texture.  I ordered it medium-rare; it was more akin to medium doneness.  For variety, I requested a side of their veal reduction sauce.  Hand cut frites were served alongside my steak.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a very large serving of their mouth-watering, Bananas Foster.  A soft Crêpe, filled with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and plated over a pool of rich, buttery caramel sauce, topped with sliced bananas and cream, would have surely sent my knees buckling if I were standing. \n\nThe two hours that we had spent there could have continued through the wee hours of the evening.  With romantic company, a lovely meal at sunset, sipping wine with an elevated view of the Strip and beautiful music emanating from Bellagio's water fountain show, just added to the most perfect evening.\n\nUntil we return, we are left to reminisce."

  "text" : "I like the place - made the reservation through yelp's little iOS app. No issues getting in at the appropriate time, although i highly recommend getting an outdoor table instead of indoors. I actually would rate the food/ambiance four stars, but our waiter was really terrible. He seemed disinterested in providing any kind of service, had poor timing, and was very snooty when we didn't get a California wine. (70-1800 for one of those)\n\nI had the Salmon, my wife had the scallops, and the actual food was quite good. I guess though, if i am at a 'spendy' restaurant, I expect the wait staff to at least be on 'spendy' level - this guy wouldn't have cut it as your waitress at Denny's.\n\nAnd since the wait staff IS part of the dining experience, that is why they are dinged down to 3 stars, despite having great food and an overall pleasant atmosphere."

Enjoyed our time there at the bar there was a lovely bar tender we chatted with.  Our table outside was in a croner really dark but we got to people watch and enjoy th Bellagio fountains so we were happy.  We started with a oyster potato soup and it was the bomb!!  We ordered the seafood platter, Maine lobster, shrimp, oysters for two and it was not very good.  It all tasted like it was frozen and lacked flavor really not good.  I guess we should have tried something else, we will go back but don't order that.  So I give this 4 stars for the restaurant  location etc, but the food was lacking so I have to downgrade to  3 stars."

  "text" : "Beautiful restaurant whether you sit out on the patio or not. I have had the fortune of going to Mon Ami Gabi several times, and all have been delightful. I usually go for brunch but my last visit was for dinner.  I would highly recommend a reservation as the wait time is usually 20-40 minutes, and if you want to sit at the patio for dinner... forget about it! Needless to say, if you want to do so, make sure you arrive early and when you are not hungry.  \n\nThe menu consists of French classics with a few twists. I like that the menu does not have many items and it is unpretentious. Last night I ordered the scallops with Brussels sprouts and butternut squash sauce. It was outstanding! The dish came with 4 (medium sized) perfectly cooked scallops.  The brussels sprouts were the best I've had in my life, seasoned to perfection, and then dipped in a little of the butternut squash sauce... WOW! Just writing about it makes me want to go back. \n\nThe service is very good, servers are knowledgeable. I once went and the server accidentally spilled a bloody mary on me.  The manager came over and handled the situation very well. As I was once a server myself, I know how mortifying it is to spill on a guest while serving them. No worries though, the server was very apologetic and the manager came over and spoke with me. \n\nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE my friend Gabi!"

  "text" : "We had a lovely time at Mon Ami Gabi before seeing \"O\" across the street at the Bellagio. Reservations are a must unless you arrive early or are prepared to wait. The restaurant is affordable fine dining for the Strip (if you can't splurge for Michelin-starred Robuchon or Nobu) so we thoroughly enjoyed it but only noticed a few drawbacks. \n\nIt was cold and rainy outside so we skipped the patio (though it did have heat lamps) and we liked the fancy, romantic atmosphere inside. The entrance to the restaurant is inside the Paris casino, so there definitely is the smell of smoke inside the restaurant - not overpowering but a little disappointing. \n\nThe service was very professional - our waitress asked us our evening plans and made sure our food arrive promptly so we could get to it on time. We loved the complimentary warm baguette with butter and the small plate of pickled shredded beets that accompanies it. \n\nFood was delicious. I had the Roquefort steak (blue cheese sauce) with frites and though I ordered it medium-well, I was very thankful when it came out an absolutely perfect medium (usually I order MW because some restaurants either over- or under-cook their medium). The dollop of blue cheese spread over the meat was divine and the size of the steak was perfect - generous but not too heavy. The frites were good, but a bit too salty to finish them all.\n\nMy friend ordered the salmon tartare, served in a lovely glass with avocado and a side of gaufrette chips (thinly-sliced waffle chips) that seemed to be house-made. The plate was garnished with assorted olives and caper berries. She loved it all. \n\nMy other friend ordered the warm goat cheese salad - mixed greens, oven-dried tomatoes, and herbs served with a warm, creamy, mustardy but light vinaigrette. It was simple but right en pointe. \n\nThis place is very popular for a reason - it's centrally located and very reasonably-priced for a delicious dinner right in the middle of all the excitement. We all loved our dinners, but the finer details of a 5-star experience just weren't there - the tables were a little too close together (probably to accommodate as many guests as possible), which wasn't a problem until it got very busy right when we left and two other patrons had to literally squeeze into the table next to us. It also is awkward that you have to walk through part of the casino to get to the restrooms, which were not very clean and crowded with casino patrons. Even though smoking is not permitted in the restaurant, we wished there wasn't associated-casino smoke floating in.\n\nAll in all, we'd definitely return, but knowing those things ahead of time can prepare you for a great dinner and just a good dining experience."

  "text" : "Lettuce Entertain You's Mon Ami Gabi is a triumphant disaster. In a town where service is of upmost importance, Mon Ami Gabi's waitstaff wouldn't be acceptable at a prison cafeteria. The coven that awaits you at the hostess desk is comprised of people who were rejected from even the local Denny's. The food quality is exceptionally poor and is surprising to find outside of a second rate Casino's buffet. The Filet Mignon Merlot was fatty and had almost a strange jelly like taste. The beef bourguignon was simply tragic with a mound of what was supposed to be egg noodles but could have been tape worms for all Monkey could tell in the poorly lit venue.  Mon Ami Gabi receives two stars as it has a decent view of the strip and respectable manager Kyle.  If you do choose Mon Ami Gabi, just simply order a bottle of wine and order the children's Mac n cheese and watch the strip without wasting time with the food that only the most unsophisticated tourist would find palatable.  Monkey wanted to enjoy Mon Ami Gabi since they have branches in Maryland and Virginia near Monkey's mom house.  Additionally Monkey wanted to be psyched about a trip to Paris but oh well c'est la vie."

I came here because members of my dining group wanted to come here. Not to sound unimpressed, pretentious and a mega jerk but most fine dining restaurants in Montreal and Quebec will do a great job of frites steak. Also, many restaurants have excellent selection and usually 10+ different ways of serving frites moules. So....eating French in Vegas is a bit kitschy for this guy. But of course it serves the Paris well and those who live far from France or Quebec. \n\nWhen you enter the restaurant it sure gives you the feeling of being in a Paris bistro in some back alley arrondissement. They did an admirable job here in decor and design. If you can get a table on the patio you have some fantastic views in the evening of the Bellagio fountain as it goes off. \n\nSince we gorged ourselves on the Bachannal Buffet (Caesars) earlier I was not super hungry. We started off with some apps of oysters, scallops. Both were fresh and done perfectly. Then I decided to have the warm goat cheese salad. It was very flavourful, lighter and I'd highly recommend it if you are down with goat cheese. To finish off I really love a good chocolate mousse so I selected this. It was a larger portion but light, chocolatey and delicious.\n\nOne word of caution, no restroom in the restaurant. You need to exit the restaurant and follow on the left side by the sports book in the casino. \n\nOverall everyone in our group had a great meal with awesome conversation. The restaurant is not cheap but this is the norm in Vegas."

I love crepes but I really didn't like the pancakes they were nice and light just needed a little sweetness in the batter for my taste. I can see how many would like them.  The fruit bouquet is great to share and very fresh. Coffee is good and they keep it flowing. Date glazed bacon a must if you like bacon. My hubby got the corned beef hash and they use nice big pieces of freshly cooked corned beef it was very good and top quality not greasy. The muffins are great as well.

Our party of 13 met up at MAG this past Saturday at 9:00am.  We had reservations (definitely recommended) and were seated in one of the corner rooms with large windows and a great view of the Strip where we could people-watch during our meal.  Tourists are so entertaining!\n\n-Corned Beef Hash and Eggs:  I am a fan of this dish for breakfast and MAG's version was good, but I could have used more corned beef.  The menu lists this dish as being served with poached eggs, but our waitress said I could have egg whites if so desired, and so I did.  It also comes with two pieces of toast and that bread was delicious with butter.  \n-The b/f and I ordered a pain au chocolat to share, but disappointingly it came out with our food.  I guess I should have specified that we wanted it first so we'd have something to nosh on while we waited for the main course.  As it turned out, it was served cold; I guess I should have requested it warmed up, too.  It was ok, but I've had better.\n\nSince this place is located right on the Strip, it was extremely busy, filled with large groups of tourists and several bachelorette party gals.  By the time we departed, the restaurant was packed to the gills with other people waiting to be seated.  Nevertheless, our big group experienced attentive service and our birthday girl got a free dessert with candle while we sang to her.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the place as well as the service.  I do want to come back and dine on the patio for dinner, which I've heard is the best way to go, so we'll be back someday soon.  For now, it's a solid three stars for my first time."

  "text" : "Wow! What a treat! This was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had; practically perfect in every way. If they are this meticulous at breakfast, I can't wait to have dinner at this fine restaurant.\nWe were seated promptly in the glass enclosed dining area that lies between the main dining room and the patio dining area. This was really perfect, as it allowed us to dine in the sunlight without the noise of the street or weather concerns.\nOur server was prompt and courteous, taking our order quickly without making us feel hurried. Our plates arrived lightning fast (about five minutes).\nMy favorite breakfast dish is Eggs Benedict. I figured this would be the perfect place to get my favorite dish, and I was sooo right! It was almost perfect. The English muffins were artisan quality and toasted perfectly. Each one was topped with two slices of ham and a PERFECTLY poached egg. These are no mass-produced, grocery store eggs; they are high quality, farm-fresh eggs with beautiful, rich yolks. All of this was topped with delicious Hollandaise sauce. Here is the only possible issue, and it is actually due to an embarrassment of riches. The eggs need a little bit more sauce, but only because of the richness of the yolks. Once that yolk is released, the Hollandaise is lost. A little extra to balance the dish would be absolute perfection. As it was, this was still the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had (the hash browns were good also). Plus, the orange juice I ordered was fresh squeezed (and I mean FRESH).\nOne of our favorite desserts is Bananas Foster, so when my wife saw Bananas Foster waffles, she was in. Again; SOOO GOOD! A perfect Bananas Foster draped over waffles that were nice and fluffy inside and perfectly crispy outside. They were served with warm maple syrup in a small ramekin (completely unnecessary) and fresh whipped cream in a sauce boat (completely appreciated)."

Mon Ami Gabi has a very romantic atmosphere as well as great service.  The view from the patio where we were dined  was also great.  We saw the water show at the Bellagio four times during our dinner.  Unfortunately, our excitement dissipated more quickly than our food. Started with escargot which required seasoning.  My wife ordered the trout almondine which she said was tasty but had numerous scales.  My steak frites was less than memorable. To be honest, the steak was cooked as requested, but did not warrant a return visit. The potatoes were so overcooked, I couldn't use a utensil to eat them. These are not major issues, but I do expect more for what I paid. Won't be back!"

With over 4000 reviews and an average of 4 stars, I expected... more.\n\nAs one of the most highlighted (and expensive) things on the menu, you'd think that the steak frites would be amazing.  In reality, my \"medium rare\" was a thoroughly chewy well done.  It seemed like they tried to cover that by over seasoning it.  It was edible and I'd rate it somewhere around a Chilli's or Outback Steakhouse level of steak.\n\nThe one saving grace here was the frites.  It was like someone deep fried crack and potatoes together, creating some ungodly balance of crisp outside to tender inside.  I only wish that Mon Ami Gabi would put as much effort into the main course as the accompaniment."

Why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a French resto?\n\nBone-in rib-eye- 5 star. It was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. I had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. The fries (think french fry chips) were okay. I wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. The burnaise sauce was SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. Dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \n\nCaramelized scallops with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. The scallops were OK. It was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go I guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. The standout is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS that were included. This is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \nThey were the BEST Brussel Sprouts I have EVER had in my life. It was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \nfantabulous. You can order these as a side. \n\nMussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. I wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. It was OK for me. I couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \n\nMacaroni Gratin- 3 star. This was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. It wasn't spectacular or memorable, and I'd skip this next time. Plus, it's carby...I just did you a huge favor. \n\nFree dessert for my bday- some Eclair with ice cream. Meh, but it was free. \n\nAs strange as this may sound, I'd go back here JUST to eat the brussels sprouts.

(I didn't want potatoes so they switched them out for some fresh tomatoes).\nThe waitress took great care of us and we had a great time. They also have a Bloody Mary bar during breakfast where they bring you the vodka in a glass and then you go add whatever else you want in it and make it just how you want it. Delish.

Last pet peve, as I walked through the restaurant to find a restroom all were too busy to ask if they could help, I was obviously lost, and when I tried to walk back to my table after not finding a restroom not 1 but 6 bussers and waiters jumped right in front of me. Never have I high end restaurant employee cut me off without a second look. I think a bit of staff training is in order that's why I'm leaving a 3 star hope to see it improve in the future :)"

While the place was packed, the wait time was extremely reasonable (they told us 30-40 minutes for patio seating, but we ended up only waiting about 15 minutes). \n\nThe people watch is awesome, as expected, being seated right along the strip. \n\nThe food was delicious. While the eggs benedict was satisfying, it was pretty standard, flavor-wise. I actually think Baby Stacks does a more flavorful version. The star of the show were the fresh chocolate croissants."

  "text" : "We made reservations for brunch on Saturday. It turns out that if you make a reservation, you must sit inside the restaurant, so we opted to wait the 45 minutes for a table outside. Since they have a make-it-yourself bloody Mary bar on the weekend, we tried that. It's fun to make it yourself, as spicy as you like it, and there are a lot of fun things to garnish your drink with. Also, at $12.00, it was less than a glass of champagne we had had the day before at another location. A lovely baguette and butter was delivered to our table shortly after we returned with our drinks. We were really hungry, and it was so tempting that I ate too much before my food arrived. The jumbo crabcake was pretty good, not the best I have ever had, but pretty good. I also ordered the small house salad, which was very simple, fresh, and good. My friend ordered the ham and cheese crepe. Everything about it tasted good, but the ham wasn't heated through and most of the cheese was unmelted. That was a little strange.\n\nThis place is CROWDED and BUSY. You really have to navigate carefully through the place to get to and from your table. Sitting across the street and watching the fountains at the Bellagio was fantastic. The people watching was great, as well. A band from Seattle U even went by as we were eating.\n\nOverall, this was a really fun experience. The waiters were very friendly and efficient. Even though the place is packed, with people waiting for tables, they don't make you feel rushed to leave. I would definitely go back."

De plus la carte n'est pas extrêmement cher comparé aux autres restaurants autour. \n\nLa carte présente beaucoup de plats Français ainsi que beaucoup de vin Français. Pour avoir essayer la soupe à l'oignon ainsi qu'un truite nous étions convaincu ! La qualité est là. \nDe plus nous avions du pain et du beurre pour patienter. Les desserts typiquement Français sont délicieux, la crème brûlée fut parfaite.\n\nL'ambiance est romantique, on retrouve un peu l'ambiance de certains bistro haut de gamme de Paris. Il est possible de manger à l'intérieur, à l'extérieur et ainsi que dans la véranda. Il y a des parasols chauffants pour l'extérieur lorsque la fraicheur du désert s'installe. \n\nLe service fait un peu usine, les serveurs installent les convives aux tables qu'ils leur sont attribués par radio. Mais une fois installé et que son serveur attitré s'occupent de nous, tout va bien. \n\nPour ceux qui veulent manger Français à Vegas sans pour autant dépenser une fortune, ce restaurant est tout à fait correct."

The broth is out fabulous, and they put in the right amount of bread and cheese. The French bread is just as good, always fresh out of the oven , and their butter tastes better too for some reason. My favorite is the Steak Frites with blue cheese butter. The meat isn't a premium cut, but they serve it thin and cooked full of flavor. Their French fries are great too. The truth is, this is a great meal."

Nice but not snooty, pricey but affordable, dressy but casual, gluten-free options, and excellent food and service. Went for dinner and made reservations for brunch the next day right away. \nI got to try a variety of dishes. The steak frites are long, thin sirloin cuts of meat and you choose a topping like blue cheese sauce.  It comes with Pom frites but you can choose any side. I would recommend the mushrooms even though the whipped cauliflower and garlic spinach were good also. The baked Brie drizzled with honey was AMAZING. It left me wanting to order 3 more! It was creamy and a little sweet: and so was the roasted garlic that came with it. Had to order the creme brûlée of course. I loved the burnt vanilla bean at the bottom. Last but not least, I found my new favorite cocktail here, the Paris Romance (Malibu, Disarrono, and fruit juices). I even had one the next morning for brunch at 10:45 am heehee. Needless to say, I want to go back to Vegas just to eat at Mon Ami Gabi."

It's good. I take a few bites but prefer my deliciously light Quiche. Plus1 takes the steak back. :-)  No room for dessert. We finish lunch about 12:45. We had planned to eat dinner but lunch last us all day. I did not even snack later. Had a few drinks later but no more food for the day.

Again. \n\n   I decided to sit at the bar since it was only myself and the restaurant seemed busy..no need to take up an entire table. There was only one seat left at the bar. To my left there was a nice couple from the Midwest, to my right, a 70 year old lady that reeked of mothballs with eye makeup that would make your mother blush and fishnet stockings. I figured, eh, this is Vegas.\n\n   I started off with oysters, Kumomoto I believe? The oysters tasted good but the mignonette that accompanied them tasted of pure vinegar. Now I know mignonette is a vinegar-based condiment, but I tasted nothing else. No onion taste, no black pepper. Nothing. I know a great champagne mignonette recipe I could share with them...\n\n   For my lunch entree I had escargot. I had been craving it for the past week and could not wait to try it here. I'm not sure how to describe the taste other than being \"off.\" I am almost positive restaurants get escargot from a can, so how can you screw it up? I told myself I wasn't going to finish the snails and I didn't. Turns out that was probably a smart idea. \n\n   I did a little shopping afterwards and starting to feel a little off. I was dizzy and in a lot of pain, showing symptoms of food poisoning. Later that evening I flew home to Miami, and let me tell you, you don't know true h*ll until you have had food poisoning on a red eye flight."

They sat me at a tiny two top right near the POS when I was the first and one of the only diners there.\nWhen I asked to move, a security guard of some sort with an ear piece strongly tried to talk me out of moving to a table set for four. He said sitting in a four table by myself would be odd and that it is the \"busiest restaurant in America.\" .....possibly a slight exaggeration, because by the time I left about an hour later there were only about six other parties at most. I probably should have left then and there as soon as he said that, but I didn't really have a choice as this was the only place open and I was supposed to meet someone there. \nI am sure this place gets busy as hell and I am sure it is an extra chore to clear and reset places and yada yada and I am sure that a 20 dollar check does not ensure dancing acrobats, but I am paying for a decent time, service and meal just like anyone else and there was NO ONE else there. \nBad form! Rude comment! Distasteful! This place has an overinflated opinion of itself, really I had an omelette and a cappacino and it was tiny and the hashbrowns were burnt. I think I made something similar to the omelette once with my leftovers. Horrendous! This was the first time in a long long long time that I truly did not want to pay for this meal, and I am never one of those......\nTo be fair, if I came here on a different day with some friends it probably would have been different, and there is a terrific view of the Bellagio of course, and maybe the food would have been fine and with a large crowd the ambiance would have been pleasant so perhaps this overall four star rating is accurate, but I only have my own experience.  \nAlso, I could tell the hostesses did not care for my attire or my suitcases and I got several dirty looks from a lot of the staff on the way out. Get over yourself! It was freaking 7:00 in the morning. It's freaking Vegas, people are coming and going and traveling for long hours and may or may not have been up for several days. They only have a restroom in the dingy casino, they are under a mockup of the Eiffel tower. Hillarious! \nI must say that the server, an older blonde lady, was nice and sweet and a doll...."

Let me just say that this croque monsieur was by far the best one I have EVER had. The steak sandwich was also great but paled in comparison to the croque monsieur! Overall, the meal was fantastic and I would highly recommend eating here!"

You're bound to get stuck paying outrageous prices for mediocre food or perhaps poor service....not the case here. \n\nPrices are very reasonable and all portions are large (I recommend the baked goat cheese appetizer). The view of the Bellagio fountains is perfect during one's evening dinner. While our server seemed very busy, I was pleasantly surprised by his busboy assistant. My water glass was never empty and he even offered more baguettes as he saw the basket nearing empty on our appetizer. \n\nI would not rave about the the frites that accompanied my filet, and the service by the server could have been a little more attentive (but I'm just being picky here). \n\nOverall- best value I've found in vegas. You get just about everything you would at a pricier restaurant for much less here. \n\n4.5 stars."

My family looked at the dessert menu and new we would have to come back, because we were stuffed. Our waitress gave us a free mini dessert as a \"teaser\" after we paid even though she wouldn't even be working the next night. We went back and I got the bananas foster crepe. It was perfection."

Their brunch menu is limited and they only have a few dishes. We ended up having food from their regular menu and i must say, we were not disappointed. We had the chicken liver pate and its aaaamazing! I think that would have to be the best thing we had. It came with a little sauce which pairs with it well. We also had chicken and mushroom crepe and a lobster roll. The crepe was perfection, the chicken just right, the sauce rich and creamy. It was a little heavy but that is kind of expected for French food. The lobster roll was good, the lobster was really fresh. Highly recommend making a reservation, we got seated right away and we got a seat near the patio. Got a glimpse of the Bellagio fountains."

She even took a couple pictures of us with the fountains in the background and brought us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.\n\nAll of the food was very good.

I'm a huge fan of green beans and I haven't had green beans I didn't like. What I do like is that they use hericot green beans instead of the thick waxy ones. A bit overcooked but seasoned extremely well.\n\nI had a bite of the hangar steak and it was very good. I also had a bite of the salmon salad...also tasty.

One of the pieces of shrimp had a very odd texture to it almost like it had frostbite rubbery but dry texture to it.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the scallop dinner which came with brussel sprouts and pureed butternut squash.  The scallops were VERY sandy and did not care for the taste of the butternut squash.\n\nMy husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Paillard.  The chicken was good, but it came with some type of squash that was extremely dry, lacked flavor and was overly charred from the broiler.  It was inedible.  \n\nService from the waiter was average.  We got better service from the individual who brought our bread and beverages. The waiter never once asked me if my meal was good.  \n\nUnfortunately, this is not somewhere we will come again and it's even more unfortunate we received very poor meals on our anniversary.\n\nOn a positive note, the ambiance of sitting outside was wonderful.

On our last trip we did lunch one day, which was amazing....best gluten free bread!\nBreakfast the next morning wasn't super amazing, so I would say lunch or dinner is better.\nLast evening we went for dinner about 6:30 with reservations and waited about 15 minutes to be seated, but upon seating promptly greeted and given water.\nWe got the salmon appetizer to start and a round of drinks. We then got the bourdelaise steak, French onion soup, asparagus, and two sides of the cauliflower purée as it was tasty, plus Caesar salad which we all shared (3 of us)"

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi is a beautiful place and one of these days, I will make it to the patio to enjoy a light lunch and people watch.\n\nUnfortunately, last evening did not meet my expectations.  I had reservations for 3 at 6.30p to celebrate a friend's birthday. Since we had reservations, one would think we wouldn't have to wait in the walk-in line and take 20 minutes just to get to the front desk.  They did have another line for 'Patio Wait List' but evidently reservations are not their main concern.  So noted for future visits.\n\nWe were seated rather quickly once getting to the desk altho the waiting area was cramped and we were shuffled about as three servers made their way to the front who then were in our way to get through to be seated.  \n\nThat experience was not pleasant all around... but once seated, we had exceptional service by the wait staff.  After a few minutes and cocktails in hand, the 'seating experience' was left behind.\n\nWe ordered the Sea Scallops (friend said they were good), the Filet Mignon Merlot and mushrooms (birthday boy cleaned his plate so no complaint there) and I had the Steak Frittes Rouquefort.  Sad to say it was grisly and chewy and not up to par for the price paid for it.   I didn't complain so I can't say how it would have been handled, but I didn't eat half of it and did not ask for it to go.  A few bucks wasted there.\n\nSo ambiance and service once seated  4 stars.\nFood and price:    2 stars\nSeating process:  1 star\nI will save any 5 stars for when I make it to the patio and NOT have steak."

I got my Eggs Benedict with spinach so it's not quite as rich and I can justify it as being healthy! It was not very hot today but still delicious. The French Toast is made from brioche so it's light and fluffy and comes with a blueberry topping and blueberry syrup. The coffee is very good and the servers keep your cup filled. It's a little pricey but typical for eateries on the Strip. Sit outside if you like to people watch."

My girlfriend and I are sort of 'Breakfast snobs', so we had very high expectations. \n\nI ordered the Eggs Florentine Benedict. My girlfriend ordered a keish. We also ordered a side of bacon, as that is a pretty big deal in our house. :)\n\nEverything was delicious. My eggs were perfectly poached. The english muffin that it was served on was made fresh in-house. The service was sort of slow when it came time for the check, but the place was jam packed, so I understood. \n\nThe prices, including a couple breakfast cocktails, were comparable to price that you would pay at the neighboring buffets (assuming you eat reasonable portions). \n\nSo if you are looking for a GREAT breakfast spot that will not break the bank, and does not serve food that is sitting under a heat lamp, this is the place for you."

  "text" : "Mon Amis always been one of my favorites every time I visit the strip. Located inside of Paris, the outdoor seating in the heart of the city is one of the best in terms of setting and ambiance. The one thing I do love about Mon Ami is the flexibility with the menu. Most places refuse to serve breakfast items after a particular time but this restaurant always accommodates my requests and the service is typically on point. The waiters are not overly enthusiastic, but they are friendly and quick which, I believe, are better qualities to portray in food hospitality. On this particular visit I ordered: \n\nWarm triple cream cheese: with mushrooms, black garlic and sherry reduction. Be warned this item is garlicky, but it is delicious. If you love mushrooms and garlic this is a must try. The toasted bread with the gooey cream cheese and garlicky sautéed mushrooms are  an amazing flavor combo. \n\nShrimp cocktail: jumbo shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemon. The shrimp is very fresh and the simplicity of the dish speaks for itself. \n\nMaine lobster roll: served on a toasted brioche roll with house chips on the side. The lobster is fresh and mixed with a creamy mayonnaise. This is one of the heavier items on the menu; if you do not like mayo, you may want to skip out on this one. The chips are also a bit bland, but can be subbed out for house fries, which are delicious. \n\nCustom crepe: I wanted to order a sweet crepe and the waiter suggested a fresh banana and strawberry crepe with whipped cream. I opted for this dish and added a side of Nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) to my crepe. The crepe was served on its own with the toppings served on the side. The fruit was fresh and the cream was whipped in house. The portion is also very large and can easily be shared between two people. \n\nAll in all, I recommend Mon Ami if you enjoy French cuisine and a great view. Although I cannot vouch for every food item on the menu, but there are several items that I always eat when I am here. There is typically a wait to sit outside, even on the weekdays, but well worth it!"

Because it's not only a steakhouse, you get a fantastic menu with seafood, steaks, poultry and a small amount of vegetarian fare. I chose the dijon steak frites option and it was excellent. I almost went for the pork chop but really needed a dose of iron. I had the caesar to start and it was quite unique; the chili oil definitely gives it a kick. You can barely taste the anchovy, which some people would like. \n\nThe wine and spirits is list is impressive and the ambiance is fantastic; dark and romantic. It's a bustling environment just like a busy cafe along the streets of Paris. But a look outside the 'windows' has you starting at slot machines.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation through OpenTable before approaching as the line runs long most evenings."

It's a super large restaurant with different sections to accommodate various types of customers and groups. \n\nAmbiance: The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit for those who want a romantic dining experience. It is also very large inside so reservations and walk-in diners are seated promptly. The exterior of the restaurant where we sat was awesome, right smack in front of the Bellagio. \n\nService: Our server was very knowledgeable and kind. He gave us a rundown of the dish of the day and soup of the day. Water glasses were always filled up and food arrived promptly even though the restaurant was packed. Overall the service receives a 5 star.\n\nFood: Like every fine dining restaurant, COMPLIMENTARY BREAD woo! My girlfriend and I shared a 22oz ribeye steak cooked to medium rare which came with french fries that were made differently from your average American style fries. It also came with this sauce that I had no idea was until my friend told me it was butter..... I BASICALLY DRANK THAT SAUCE WITH THE FRIES (No wonder I gained 5 pounds after my trip). The steak was cooked to somewhat rare but it didn't bother me because it was so delicious. However, since they didn't cook it to my liking, -1 star.\n\nI'd come back here if I'm back in Vegas, for sure."

When we arrived, they seated us promptly. The restaurant was packed! We got seated near the patio but still on the inside of the restaurant. The seating was perfect because it wasn't too sunny or too dark; it was just right.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to share the classic steak frites. I didn't try any of the other dishes that the rest of the party ordered, so this review is solely based off of my entree.\n\nWe ordered the steak medium rare (why would you order steak any other way?). Only half of our steak was cooked medium rare. Because the cut was uneven, the other half was more medium/medium well. However, the butter that came with the steak was delicious! The flavor of the meat was good, but it was not hot. It felt like maybe it was sitting out for a while before it was served.\n\nThe plate also came with fries (the frites portion). It looked like it was hand cut in the kitchen which excited me, but my first one was really soggy. I grabbed another on that looked a little less soggy and it was nice and crispy. Unfortunately, half were soggy and limp.\n\nAt the end of the meal, several other girls mentioned that their food was lukewarm as well. If my meal was hot, it would have been a completely different experience."

The cooking is always to perfection, but the flavoring can be a little bit more bold. Slightly on the expensive side, but it is worth the experience and food.\n\n1st time: Breakfast\n\nLemon Pancake - For me this pancake was slightly denser and dryer than I would like. The flavor was very vanilla and hint of lemon (not too lemon-y, which I prefer, but if you like the lemon flavor to hit you hard; this is not for you.)\n\nSmoked Salmon Benedict - I loved this plate! The English muffin was crisp, buttery, and light. The smoked salmon was generous, egg yolk was just the right consistency (runny), and the hollandaise sauce was amazing!  \n\n2nd time: Lunch\n\nLemon Salmon - Both the salmon and vegetable was cooked to perfection, but slightly bland on the flavor profile.\n\n3rd time: Dinner\n\nFilet Mignon Merlot - Cooked to perfection (asked for Medium) and the red wine sauce was delicious. \n\nMussels Martiniere - Wow, the broth had such a deep flavor, the white wine, sea, and butter! \n\nCreme Brulee - So delicious, it was very vanilla like and lite custard (doesn't taste like eggy cake).

There was no wait and were seated right away in the patio area with reservations... Although they don't take reservations for that area.  YAY.  \n\nWe started off with the mussels in white wine sauce which was BOMB.  It wasn't as heavy and creamy as I expected it to be.  The sauce and mussels were cooked perfectly. \n\nBRUNCH:\n\nThe Corn Beef Hash with poached eggs was just okay.  Although my friend wasn't a fan, I thought it was okay.  Eggs Benedict was good but the muffin was extremely hard.  My friend's muffin was almost burnt.  Wonder if this is how it's usually served here.. Hashbrown was yummy but you can tell that they used a ton of butter..\n\nThe menu was reasonably priced (ESP the brunch menu).  I don't understand all the \"overpriced\" complaints here. The Banh Mi sandwhich was yummy and baguette used was surprisingly soft.   Frites were also good and you can taste that it was made from fresh potatoes.. But it was more on the harder & crispier side.  Are frites supposed to be served crispy??  I guess that's what I get for expecting french fries.   For some reason I thought it was the same thing.  \n\nService was a bit on the slow side as it was pretty packed in the restaurant.  But overall everything was great and I would definitely go back for brunch!"

You're in a sophisticated French restaurant but immersed in the Vegas feel, especially when you dine in the outdoor area. You have a beautiful view of the Bellagio and if you dine after 4:30 you have an awesome view of the Bellagio water show, just amazing.\n\nOur server was attentive and very nice; glad to know professional customer service is important. Even if the meal was mediocre...and it wasn't, we would go back for the level of attention to detail."

Ibrahim, our waiter had an attitude from the beginning. His demeanor was more smug and arrogant than friendly. From food choices to splitting the bill everything seemed to be an ordeal. I expect better service from a restaurant of this caliber. I would suggest selective training on basic customer service or better yet improved hiring standards."

We were SOL though at noon on a weekday. Server said it wasn't \"fair\" to the cooks to have to serve a breakfast menu along with the lunch menu. OK, whatever.\n\nDH ordered a burger medium rare with fruit and I ordered a croque monsieur. Burger was served with fries instead. Got the fruit after bringing to server's attention. Burger came medium and was really dry. My sandwich was horrid. Bread was stale, not crisp and fries were Meh. Only thing really impressed with was the baguette and sangria.\n\nServer was pretty nice though. Sat inside and wasn't crowed at all on a Tuesday.

I probably won't order the chicken because it was half of a rotisserie chicken and I don't want to work for the food. Unless I'm at boiling crab or eating kbbq then that's understandable. \n\nWe came with a party of 18 and they provided complimentary champagne for all the ladies. When we received our bill, 15% gratuity was added - ok. But an additional 5% for table charge because we called in to reserve a table. \n\nOver all..my experience was a little above mediocre.

We love trying food places we haven't been to, & heard about this place from multiple people especially my brother & his girlfriend. Their food was the perfect portion size, & it was my first time trying escargot, & the way they seasoned it was AMAZING! Our servers were fantastic. We were originally seated outside with the sun facing us, & it got too hot, so our server was able to switch us to more shaded table. The staff was very friendly & outgoing. \n\nI ordered the scallop, per recommendation of my waiter because I wasn't too sure yet. It was perfect. It just melted in my mouth & the plate representation was simple, but chic. The escargot was interesting, & they were smart to prepare it without the shell. We used the rest of the sauce for our bread. \n\nWe also ended up ordering desserts, the caramel creme brûlée & the banana crepes. I love creme brûlée & theirs was just delicious. It wasn't too sweet, nor too bland, it had the perfect hint of caramel flavoring - so it didn't exactly taste like leche flan. \n\nThe price for our meal was about a total of $150, 2 entrees, 1 appetizer, & 2 desserts & 2 glasses of wine. I thought it was going to cost more, but it was just enough for everything we ordered."

I ordered the French martini and it was fantastic, although it took 25 mins to come.

One of the best onion soups I've had.  \nWe enjoyed the patio, but many tables and us had to beg for the umbrellas to be raised to find some relief from afternoon sun.   At first we all were told no, but then they accommodated everyone.   Yay!  Mon Ami was recommended to us by a couple of locals,   It had a great setting inside or out.

I have had the pleasure to dine here on multiple occasions both inside the restaurant as well at the outdoor patio seating. \n\nSteak frites - they have a great selection of different preparations of steak frites. I really enjoyed this dish, the steak was cooked well and enjoyed the crispy frites.\nEscargot - it was a treat to enjoy these piping hot snail appetizers. Cooked in butter and fresh herbs.\nFrench onion soup - one of the best French onion soups that I have had. A savory flavor with sweet onions, bread and melted cheese.\nChicken liver mousse pate - this dish is my favorite. creamy texture and delicious flavor. Served with tasty burgundy red wine mustard and cornichons, which add a nice sweet and sour touch to the pate. Comes with delicious crispy bread slices, also goes great with complimentary baguette and butter.\nSangria - cool, sweet and refreshing. Perfect to enjoy while dining out on the patio on a warm and sunny day. \n\nThe service is professional and prompt. They checked in with us regularly to make sure we are doing ok and asked if we have additional requests.\n\nThe restaurant is spacious and it gets very busy during lunch and dinner time. Make sure to arrive early to avoid long wait times. You can make a reservation on open table and Yelp!\n\nOverall I love Mon Ami Gabi. Great French bistro with a generous menu of delicious food and drinks, amazing views of the Bellagio fountains from the patio. I could sit there all day. I will definitely return in the future."

  "text" : "So the reason why this is getting 3 stars is because the steak and the scallops were sooooo yummy! However, the restaurant is kinda cramped and the waiter was quite rude.\n\nLet's start from the beginning: it was my friends 21st bday dinner!\n\nCustomer service: our waiter was rude about our drinks and just very u invested in our table. His name was Ibrahim. He was ok just didn't care much for us as customers and was rude with my friends drink. Which I did not appreciate at all. He waited for us once he gave the check and took it right away! He was overall not caring towards our table \n\nFood: So, I split my steak with my friend and she shared her scallops! \nI had the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly and sauce/butter they used to cook the steak made it taste so decandant. It was a little sweet but in a good way! The fries that were served with my steak were delicious and crispy! \nThe scallops were also very appetizing. They had this cream sauce under them that tasted amazing! The scallops were cooked well and melted in my mouth. \nHowever, I was very disappointed in my dessert! I LOVE cremé brûlée and caramel! So I ordered the caramel cremé brûlée. When it arrived to the table and I took I bite it was cold.....and it's suppose to be warm....I was so sad.\n\nAtmosphere: it's located inside the Paris hotel, and so I thought it might have a more elegant feeling but it didn't. It was very dim in the restaurant and very crowded! I also went on a rainy day so we couldn't sit outside. Overall it felt very casual."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi whisks me away on a journey of deliciousity. \n\nLocated in Paris hotel in a prominent location offering both indoor and patio seating Mon Ami Gabi has a steady stream of diners and can become very busy. The wait times can stretch over an hour, and the patio and dining room wait times are segregated so there's no getting the first available. \n\nThe restaurant has a classic ambiance with a gentle French theme. Nothing garish, nothing thematic, just very classic. The menu offers a nice variety at decent prices. \n\nRecently I came here for breakfast and ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast. I will admit, I was a little skeptical because as much as I love French Toast I often find restaurants drench it in butter and syrup and it becomes sugar toast. I was immediately pleased to see the portion sizes were reasonable. It was incredibly filling, but I didn't feel overly stuffed or defeated. \n\nThe French Toast was simply amazing. They had a light caramel sauce over the pieces and these delicious carmalized banana slices that popped with flavor. They weren't overly mushy either instead with a nice firm texture. The French Toast itself was perfect. Fluffy, but firm with just enough bananas foster flavor that I recalled the similarity to the dessert without feeling like I was eating dessert. The dish came with maple syrup and fresh whipped cream on the side in individual dishes. I would dab my toast pieces in the whipped cream but left the maple syrup alone. I felt that the maple syrup overwhelmed the banana foster flavor and saw no point in doing that. It was amazingly delicious. \n\nSo, why a 4 instead of a 5? Well, the service isn't remarkable. It feels very mechanized with everyone going through the same routine over and over until patrons are simply numbers and mouths to fill and usher out. There's no warmth, no energy among the staff here. Our waiter came, took our order, checked on how our food came out, and delivered our check. He never smiled, never broke a monotone, barely made eye contact and every person was like that from the ladies at the front desk to the people refilling our water. It felt impersonal. \n\nBut the food is delicious!"

I've only been here for lunch on the weekends but I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared:\nOnion Soup Au Gratin & Prime Steak Sandwich upon recommendation.\n\nThey also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.\nI also noticed they had a Bloody Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant that I thought was interesting.  If I was a bigger Bloody Mary fan I would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.\n\nThe Onion Soup Au Gratin was a lot bigger than expected and boy was I glad!  Definitely one of the top French Onion soups I've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  The warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  Must get!\n\nThe Prime Steak Sandwich was amaaaaaazing.  I was so happy I went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! We asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  Everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  The steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  The sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  I actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  \n\nThe service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except I do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  Maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  The prices are a bit steep but then again, it is Vegas so it's expected.  I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch."

Top sirloin is not supposed to be paper thin unless I may be missing the French train here.  It was tasteless, paper thin and served with McDonald French Fries.  I think this place is having a Griswolds in Europe laugh on all us dumb Americans.  I will say my diner partner had the scallops which were done decently, but nothing I have not had before.  But no..all in all...no.  The frangria was something done better at a frat party with whatever was left over from the previous night's frat party, our waiter was a little tout suite with our order, seeming to rush us when he was asked specifically not to.  The bread is served with grandma's carrot and raisin salad and butter.  I just was so disappointed..I was so looking forward to this place because everybody RAVES about it.  Well, alas..I am not a Griswold and I guess I know real French cooking when I get it."

Usually immediately seated if you want to stay inside so expect to wait if you want a seat with a Strip View. \nWhen I went most of the patrons at least got to sit in the pavilion so it looks half inside and half outside \n5 girls 5 different entrees so we can try each other's. My favorites were the baked goat cheese appetizer to start and Lorraine's quiche. The goat cheese is served with garlic bread and the sauce was very tasty. Everyone loved it even the goat cheese first timers. I liked the quiche the as the best entree because it was very delicate and flavorful. It felt very light. \n\nWe also had the croissant sandwich  (simple and nice), the florentine and salmon Benedict (classics) and the French toast. \n\nI think this place is pretty and delicious. The average entree price for breakfast is about $15 to $20. Warmed freshly baked bread is provided. They give butter and jam. You have a paper top on the table which I have seen at other French restaurants and proportions were a nice size. \n\nI recommend making reservations and then enjoy."

Omelette were $13-15, definitely worth every penny - they were true omelette rather than the cakey egg patties you get at a lot of places. The service was excellent (my coffee and water were never empty) as well, but what truly sets this place apart is the ambience. Situated on street level of the strip, with a view of Bellagio, Cosmo, and Caesars. Still, I didn't feel overwhelmed by strip nonsense even sitting outside. Will definitely return."

  "text" : "Was in Vegas for work and staying at the Hilton Elara not too far from Paris.  I had asked a friend who lives in Vegas for a few dinner recommendations and Mon Ami was one of the 3 places recommended - so due to being walking distance I ventured over.  Since I was rolling solo I ventured out to the patio bar and was able to luck out and find a seat on a really nice evening.  The bartenders were friendly with some funny sarcastic banter.  I asked for some recommendations as I'm not typically one to dine on French cuisine.  My average 3 star review is likely more because of my food choice but in overall I'd be hard pressed to give it a 4 based on my rating scale.  I chose the scallops which were ok but not as flavorful as I expected.  I did choose a side dish of the macaroni which was tasty and had a nice crispness to the top layer.  I consumed a few drinks and also had the banana fosters for dessert.  The tab was typical Las Vegas strip expensive which is another reason it's only ok in my book.  Would I visit again, sure....but with all the options in Vegas I'd likely want to try some other spots first."

  "text" : "I told myself not to write this review until a day had gone by so here it is. My boyfriend and I were walking around Las Vegas Blvd when we came across this restaurant. We had our pup with us so I decided to go in and ask if he could eat with us in their outdoor seating area. I went in and asked one of the hostesses if our dog could eat with us if we sit outside and she said \"Um, yeah for how many people?\" And I said two. Then she said it will be an hour wait for outside. So I went back outside to ask my boyfriend if the wait time was fine and he said ok, so I went back in and told the same hostess that we would wait, so she took my name down and gave us a buzzer. After patiently waiting for a little over an hour our buzzer goes off, so I give it to the same hostess that took my name down. She looks down at my dog who is standing right next to me and says \"Um, is that a service dog? Because we don't allow dogs here\"...... I then said \"I asked you if we could eat outside with our dog before you took my name down\". A hostess standing next to her then says to me \"She wasn't here an hour ago\". LOL what?!!!! I was absolutely LIVID. They were basically calling me a liar. Why would I make that up and purposefully wait an entire hour when I have better things to do while on vacation. How dare they??? I remained really calm, which I now regret. I wish I would have cursed them out, I really do. If she wasn't there an hour ago then I must have been talking to her effing twin. EVEN IF they were right (which they were not) and I had asked a different hostess, someone still told me I could bring my dog!!! After the manager came out she told me it was against their health code to let dogs eat in the restaurant, even if it's outdoors, which is totally fine but why was I not told this before waiting a fucking hour?? \n\nManager lady, please check your surveillance cameras for 03/09/2015 around 12:30pm and tell me again that the same hostess did not take my name down. I DARE YOU. And I hope you reprimand your hostess for lying to a customer right to her face.\n\nAvoid this disgusting and dishonest place. They have a staff of liars working here."

For those of you who like or even love steak, head to a real steak house!\n\nWe booked a large party and the setting is quite lovely.  You will not be seated unless the majority of your party arrives.  The service is professional and seemingly friendly, but the food is \"meh.\"\n\nOur group ordered the gamut of items.  Some of us shared the mushroom appetizer which was a bit juvenile.  The presentation was nice, but the thick cream and mushroom combination was overwhelming.  \n\nWe also shared a caesar salad but, that too, was uneventful.  There were fried, cubed potatoes which was a \"psyche\" moment because I was hoping for crispy croutons to add texture and taste.\nI also ordered the scallops which, had there not been the sliced leek accompaniment, would have been good.  \n\nI tried a bit of my friend's bone-in rib eye.  I eat rib eye ALL THE TIME and found this preparation to be chewy and tasteless...a TOTAL disappointment especially since this is a steak frites restaurant.\n\nAll-in-all, I was saddened by the entire dining experience.

The busboy that we had was wonderful, the waiter, not so much.  She had a very nonchalant, I don't want to serve you attitude but after she overheard me saying that I was going to email the manager at a later date she started to brighten her attitude.  Anyway, on to the food.  I ordered the ham and cheese omelette with gruyere cheese I don't know why but I was expecting so much more but it was a disappointment.  I've had better omelettes at Denny's.  It was a little dried out and lacked flavor.  Me and my friends have a habit of everyone ordering something different and then tasting everything.  I'm thankful that we did because what they ordered definitely made up for what I had.  Friend number 1 ordered the chocolate hazelnut waffles with nutella and friend number 2 ordered the crepe with chocolate syrup which I believe was the special of the day.  Not really sure about that because the waiter wasn't really concerned with doing her shpill of what the special was.  Anyway, the both were divine.  The coffee was very weak and lukewarm for it to have been $4.  \nStill giving them 4 stars because for some reason I'm confident that when I return to this place I'll have a better experience.  Not that this experience was bad but because of the location, price and decor I expected more.  I will say that I was more intrigued with the dinner menu and when I do return hopefully I'll be with my significant other (whoever he may be) sitting on the patio eating and watching the Bellagio fountains.  Hopefully New Years Eve right at the stroke of midnight when the fireworks are released lol.  Don't judge me, I'm a hopeless romantic:)"

We originally had a party of 10, but 3 fell out, thankfully.  They had set up a 7 or 8 top table with 10 place settings.  The chairs were actually smashed against each other, if we had 10, there was no way to sit.  The table was IN the bus station/cash register.  Not 2-3 feet away, right against the table, one of our party had a waiter's butt against the back of his head for the majority of the meal.\n  We sat down, and 20 minutes later, a waiter (who had been stealing glances at the table) asked if we had been helped; NO. When we finally got a waiter, he really attempted to provide good service, but he was by himself.  The busboy had no idea what the heck was going on, maybe he was new or high.  When we asked him to remove the extra place settings, and even showed him which ones to take, he simply scooped up 3 settings on one side of the table, yeah, we'll all sit on one side...  No refills from the busboy, he tossed the bread on the table and ran...etc., very poor.\n  The escargot was about as bland as I have ever eaten and the house steaks were  thin as paper, and cold.  One guest specifically asked for no fries, and wanted veggies instead; nope, out came fries.  Like I said, the waiter tried, but it was an uphill battle.

The day we came in the patio was open but it was a little windy, so we opted to sit in the atrium area and it was a great choice, you can still see outside for people watching. The interior of the restaurant was a little dark, but would be nice and romantic for dinner time.\n\nI enjoyed the cinnamon skinny pancake, the flavors were like heaven in your mouth. My honey had the oyster Benedict and said it was fantastic. With reasonable prices and great food its a no brainer, you should definitely check it out."

We sat at the bar and ordered mimosas, when they were ready to seat us we paid for the drink, the bartender gave us our bill then started up multiple conversations before getting us change! He knew they were trying to seat us so I found this kind of annoying. \n\nWe were seated at a corner table near the waiter station. If we were trying to have a quiet brunch that table would have been a disaster, but it was perfect for people watching! \n\nOur waitress was wonderful and the food was delicious! We had bacon - thick and crispy, just the way I like it, blueberry waffle - the blueberry sauce is seriously so good!, and three eggs plate. \n\nLoved this place and the interior!"

  "text" : "It is important to be aware of the fact that this restaurant does have a different menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I personally find their lunch menu to be far more diverse and impressive than their dinner menu, which is exactly why I made it a point to venture here during the lunch hours versus later on in the evening. Making a decision on what to eat here was honestly the hardest decision that I had to make all week while being on vacation; I wanted to order one of everything, but I opted for the ever so popular seafood crepe paired with a glass of Sancerre, and there are no words that could possibly express the enjoyment that I experienced from eating this entrée.\n\nThe seafood crepe consisted of shrimp, scallops, peas and cream. It was incredibly savory and comforting at the same time. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly, not overdone, and were extremely flavorful as well. The cream sauce was not overwhelming, the touch of white wine and shallots were both pleasantly detectable, and the addition of a few peas throughout the crepe also added texture to the cream sauce.The actual crepe certainly complimented the cream sauce, but was also plenty tasty on its own. It was soft, but not too thick or thin and not overly salty or egg tasting. Although the entrée appeared to be modest in size initially, it was filling, and ultimately the perfect amount of food. \n\nOverall, Mon Ami Gabi is a phenomenal restaurant on the strip that serves relatively inexpensive French cuisine, which is astonishing for any restaurant that is located in such a prime location of Las Vegas, never mind one that serves affordable French cuisine. I have visited Las Vegas three times in the past year, and my deepest regret is not that I did not gamble, drink or party enough, but that I did not come here for lunch sooner. It's cliché of me, but words cannot express the affection that I possess for Mon Ami Gabi. I seriously yearn for this restaurant, to one day, thrust open its doors to New York City's French foodies."

I let the manager know, as we waited 45 minutes for food while everyone around us was getting served, he said he would take care of it.

  "text" : "I seriously love this place.  While Mon Ami Gabi is certainly not comprable to some of the bigger (and more expensive) names on The Strip, it holds its own without breaking the bank.\n\nI dined here with my boyfriend a few months ago and we waited it out for an outdoor table (first come, first serve - regardless of reservations).  It was so worth the wait.  Being able to watch the Bellagio water show while dining on delicious food is quite an amazing experience.  \n\nMore recently, I took my work team here for dinner.  Party of 12 required a credit card to hold the table.  Oh, and they will not seat you unless your entire party is present.  Good luck getting that many people to show up right on time.  Several people were late, so we weren't seated on time as per our reservation, and our server seemed to retaliate by making us wait for our beverages and bread.  Just kidding...he wasn't doing it on purpose. He was just slow.  Like REALLY SLOW and when people are hungry, ok service gets magnified to terrible service.  The 20min it took to get our bread was soon forgotten once the bread actually got to the table. Fresh baguettes...yum.\n\nAs far as main entrees, order a steak.  If you don't you will envy all of those around you who did.  Since I ordered a steak on my last visit, I decided to go with the carmelized sea scallops.  They were cooked perfectly, but overseasoned for my tastebuds.  I asked for lemon wedges to cut some of the saltiness.  But, I don't think that will stop me from ordering it again some time in the future in hopes that the chef won't have such a heavy hand with the salt shaker.  \n\nTwo of my coworkers ordered the Fish n Chips and could not stop raving about how yummy their meals were.  But, my eyes were on all of the other plates...steaks, steaks and more steaks.  I stole some fries off their plates when they weren't looking.  So, next time you're in Vegas and want a good meal, GET A STEAK at Mon Ami Gabi...and share your fries :)"

Especially for the type of cuisine (French) and it being right on the strip. So That was another HUGE plus. \n\nI ordered the steak tartare. This was the lonely place I have ever seen it on the menu for a entree. It was a 8oz filet mignon. Completely the best tartare I have every had, and I have been around the block few time with this dish. French food being my favorite.\n\nThe wine list could use some work.

My local crew members raved on and on about Mon Ami Gabi. Not that I need to be pressured to eat French food. \n\nMy first bit of advice is to wait until you can sit on the patio. While the Paris Casino is a Disney version of the actual Paris, the atmosphere on the patio will make you feel quite Parisian. \n\nMy second bit of advice is that you will more than likely get a spot on the patio during lunch time. There is simply less of a crowd at the door. \n\nWhen you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter. I ordered a glass of wine and a steak sandwich.

I ordered the steak frites with a glass of the Chateauneuf du pape. The flavor of the steak was delicious but it, as well as the fries were cold. Literally, the fries were cold and the steak was barely a room temperature. We had waited so long to sit and I was starving so I didn't bother returning it.  Disappointing."

I can`t say that the food was bad, it was pretty good and the server helped us to choose wine, but I didn`t like the service, it was slow. \nIt was an unimpressive place, I expected more, but I didn`t feel that boom.

I was seated immediately even though the restaurant seemed fairly busy. I was surprised at the prices since they were very reasonable considering it was a dine in restaurant on The Strip. The complimentary, fresh baguettes that they bring out are divine. If you're looking to squeeze in a date between day and night clubs, I would recommend this place."

  "text" : "I took my boyfriend here last night for our first night in Vegas and for a little birthday dinner. I give this place five stars for several reasons. First, the location/layout/decor is brilliant. It's located right next to the Bellagio (where we stayed) fountains at the Paris hotel. It's indoor seating looked beautiful, which what I had originally made 7:30 reservations for , but we opted for the first come first serve patio seating so we could catch the fountain shows. Plus, Vegas around sunset is perfect in terms of temperature and lighting.\nThe other reason I give it four stars is because the service from jump street was impeccable. The hostesses were kind and attentive. They clearly remembered to tell our waiter later on about my request for a surprise birthday dessert with a candle at the end. The bar tenders at the bar where we got a drink and an appetizer were also very attentive and fast. Our waiter later on, Ibrahim, was beyond friendly, eager to please and professional (but not overwhelmingly in our faces). \nThe other reason on give this place four stars is the food and wine. I love a French menu. The food is always fresh and made the way you expect it to be and then some. I swear, French chefs have a cooking gene that I don't think others do! All the food we had here was exquisite.  Appetizer: Wild escargot that was oven roasted In some garlic herb (and pesto I think) sauce. Salad: frisée, kale and warm bacon salad. Dinner: a rare filet mignon merlot (a butter and red wine reduction) with a side a sautéed mushrooms and hand cut fries. NOW, let me pause and comment on this Dinner dish. First, the steak was O M F G AMAZING. Perfect cut of steak and cooked JUST to our liking: RARE. Second, the red wine reduction and butter sauce we ordered on the side bc normally we would never spoil a filet mignon with any sauce, BUT again, !!!O M F G!!! this sauce blew us away. I could eat it with a spoon. You must must must order this dish of you enjoy filet. The mushrooms and fries were also very fresh and complimented the steak very nicely. OH AND, the portion sizes were fair. Not small. Not huge. Fair. Filling. Perfect amount. \nLast but not least, we ordered a bottle of their house red (a suggestion from our waiter), and I could not have been happier with it. I'm kind of a picky wine lady, but I really liked our waiter so I trusted his suggestion and I'm glad I did. Also, I really appreciated our waiter refilling our days wine glasses for us as we dined throughout the evening. \nLast but not least, the last reason I give this place four stars is the fair pricing for the quality of food. Our bill was only $111. That's about a third of what most fine dining places would cost in Vegas. For instance, the filet mignon was only $37, as opposed to $60 plus it would be at most other steak houses in Vegas. For a wonderful experience and exemplary food, $111 felt like a steal. \nMy boyfriend and I definitely plan on dining here again before we leave. If you find yourself in Vegas and want an amazing dinner with every bank for a your buck, go here!!"

Although most of the menu may be too fancy for some people's taste, there is steak so anyone could eat here. \n\nThe patio is gorgeous. Right across Las Vegas Blvd from the Bellagio fountains, and lots of people to watch, being dead center on the strip. \n\nWe had: \n\nMacaroni Gratin: I think I just died and went to heaven. Don't let the fancy shmanchy name disguise fool you. This is Mac & cheese, but better than most out there. It's just classic noodles and cheese, but the crispy melted cheese on top and the mini shells really take this one to the next level. I consider myself a Mac & cheese connoisseur, and this is an 8/10 on my Mac & cheese scale. \n\nGarlic Spinach: pretty good! I am a sucker for veggi side dishes so this one was decent. The garlic really showed up in the spinach even though sautéed spinach can overpower a lot of flavors. Delish! \n\n22 oz Rib-eye with herb butter and béarnaise sauce: I'm not a huge meat person, but my husband so is and he loved this. The ribeye is his favorite cut of meat and this one had so much flavor packed in. Not just char and meat flavor. There was a lot of depth. Texture wasn't bad either. And the frites are fantastic here. Crispy and soft. \n\nThis place is a must if you are visiting or just looking to see the strip for the first time in a long time of living here."

Tabletop baguette was hot, crusty but soft inside. Excellent!  Whipped butter on the side, too. (Yes, ask for more bread if you have the space.)\n\nWe started with the St. Germaine Spritzer (small carafe, enough for two). Sweet as expected but refreshing.  Lemon wedge, definitely worth a squeeze into the drink! :)  $14.95\n\nWild Escargots De Bourgogne were delicate and definitely, garlic heaven, so make sure to use the tabletop baguette to get out every last drop of butter! $15.95\n\nFrisée, Kale, & Bacon salad with poached egg.  It was very tangy!  Chopped thick cuts of bacon with slightly bitter frisée, finely chopped kale, and tangy dressing--and don't forget to pop the poached egg!   $12.95\n\nOnion Soup Au Gratin (French Onion Soup).  Been a long time since I've had a great French onion soup, and this place definitely hit the high notes!  Savory but a bit sweet, perfect blend and piping hot.  Hearty portion.  $10.95\n\nI chose one of the specials for the evening--Striped bass. The fish was very moist with a very crispy skin.  The fish sat on a bed of perfectly cooked Yukon Gold potatoes, tender fava beans and earthy Morel mushrooms.  Definitely a delightful dish!  The fish was fabulous! $30.95 \n\nSteak Frites, Bordelaise. Perfectly pounded steak with their signature handcut pommes frites.  The Bordelaise sauce (caramelized onion, red wine sauce) was savory and rich.  He loved it.   $28.95  (They offer various sauces, so don't fret! Classique, au poivre, dijon, roquefort and bearnaise.)\n\nWhipped Cauliflower.  This side dish stood out, and it was phenomenal. If you're in the mood for mind-blowing pureed cauliflower, with notes of cream and perfect seasoning... this is it!  $5.95 \n\nDecaf cappuccino $5.00  \nLatte $5.00\n\nAnniversary dessert--Their profiterole. French choux pastry ball filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with double chocolate fudge.  It was a very nice touch from the restaurant for a special occasion!  Much appreciated. \n\nDaily sorbet--Strawberries. This was so refreshing and a perfect end to a delicious and filling meal! $8.95\n\n\nService = excellent. Attentive, friendly, and just wonderful. Shelly P. was a fabulous server and made our visit very enjoyable!! \n\nPrices = moderate.  We went a bit overboard but it was well worth it!! Total: $150.91 with taxes. \n\nHighly recommend getting reservations ahead of time.  (If you want patio seating, it's NOT possible to get reservations for it.  There's a waitlist, and it's first-come-first-serve.)\n\nWith that being said, we ended up sitting inside with a view of the Bellagio Fountains, near the patio seating!  We enjoyed several shows of the Bellagio Fountains throughout our two hour meal, at the height of dinner service.  \n\nYes, we were impressed with the quality of food, service and ambiance!  Thank you for making our anniversary dinner be such a treat!! (And I must thank my friend for recommending this place!)  À bientôt!"

The egg Benedict hollandaise sauce didn't have the pop of flavor I was looking for. The hasbrown that came with the dish looked a chewed up and taste like a can of salt was accidentally dropped in. Baked bread for the omelete was bearly luke warm too. Not impressed"

Came here for breakfast with a group of 6 girls and everything we had was good from the egg benedicts, corned beef hash and French toast. The benedicts came with a side of hash brown that was outta this world!! I kid you not, I am a lover of hash browns and that was the best hash brown I've ever had. It was light and crispy - just how it should be. The only downside was I wished they could've thrown on a bigger portion of that  hash brown because I was wanting more of it. \n\nFor good, quality food at a decent affordable price - this is it!"

I had the French onion soup which was available on the \"not breakfast\" section, and it was hearty, but could use a little bit more seasoning. My second item I ordered was the smoked salmon and bagel, which was straightforward and clean. The smoke on the salmon was not overly harsh and I can still taste the salmon, also served with pickled garnishes which added a unique background flavour. A coulis/jam and cream cheese were the condiments, which I have nothing to say about, they were what they were. I was eating with family and they ordered items such as the flat pancakes which were well made. Otherwise, it's a humble, friendly, welcoming, busy environment, our waiter was smooth and organized, but it felt too much like bouchon though."

  "text" : "So the reason why this is getting 4 stars is because the steak and the scallops were sooooo yummy! However, the restaurant is kinda cramped and the waiter was quite rude.\n\nLet's start from the beginning: it was my friends 21st bday dinner!\n\nCustomer service: our waiter was rude about our drinks and just very u invested in our table. His name was Ibrahim. He was ok just didn't care much for us as customers and was rude with my friends drink. Which I did not appreciate at all.\n\nFood: So, I split my steak with my friend and she shared her scallops! \nI had the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly and sauce/butter they used to cook the steak made it taste so decandant. It was a little sweet but in a good way! The fries that were served with my steak were delicious and crispy! \nThe scallops were also very appetizing. They had this cream sauce under them that tasted amazing! The scallops were cooked well and melted in my mouth. \nHowever, I was very disappointed in my dessert! I LOVE cremé brûlée and caramel! So I ordered the caramel cremé brûlée. When it arrived to the table and I took I bite it was cold.....and it's suppose to be warm....I was so sad.\n\nAtmosphere: it's located inside the Paris hotel, and so I thought it might have a more elegant feeling but it didn't. It was very dim in the restaurant and very crowded! I also went on a rainy day so we couldn't sit outside. Overall it felt very casual."

  "text" : "My most recent visit to Mon Ami Gabi had a little bit of a disappointment which was really my fault for coming in at the wrong time.  Currently, their Sunday dinner special is Beef Wellington which I've been really looking forward to try.  The only Beef Wellington I've had is the one over at Gordon Ramsay Steak, so I was looking to try one from another restaurant to compare.  Well, I finally came in on a Sunday night for a late dinner and by the time I got seated, my waiter told me that they had just ran out of Beef Wellington.  Nooooooooo!!!\n\nWell, as an alternative, my waiter suggested ordering their Filet Mignon Merlot.  It's actually been a few years since I last ordered steak at MAG, so he enlightened me.  Plus, because it's a different cut of beef than the Hangar and Ribeye I've had before, it still continues my steak of ordering something new on their menu.  And to add to that, I ordered their Wild Escargot de Bourgogne appetizer.  I've never had escargot served this way so I was really intrigued.\n\nWild Escargots de Bourgogne -- http://bit.ly/1BtOrXP\nOven roasted snails, garlic-herb butter\nOh man.  Butter and garlic galore!!  The snails were chewy just like I expected and they were drowned in so much butter and garlic that I couldn't really tell if they were actually snails.  They could've been mushrooms and I probably wouldn't know the difference.  They were was good though.  And with the complimentary baguette, it was the perfect bread to dunk into the garlic-herb butter wells.\n\nFilet Mignon Merlot -- http://bit.ly/1QHYGP5\nButter, red wine reduction\nI understand that Mon Ami Gabi is more of a budget friendly steakhouse that's part of  the middle tier of steakhouses on the strip, but I have to say that this Filet Mignon was awesome!  Cooked to a perfect medium rare and it literally cut like butter! (http://bit.ly/1N0fjPX)  And the Red Wine Reduction sauce just added a more robust flavor to the Filet.  I'm so glad that I ordered this!  Kudos to my waiter for the recommendation!\n\nMon Ami Gabi delivers once again even when there's disappointment with an item being sold out.  I love how there's plenty of 'Plan B' entrees and based on my past visits, I really couldn't have gone wrong with any of them, but I'm glad that I got to try their Filet Mignon Merlot.  That's something that I wouldn't mind ordering again if I ever go back for to Mon Ami Gabi for steak.  Hopefully next time I'll make better judgement with coming in for an earlier dinner so I can finally try their Beef Wellington.  Til next time Mon Ami Gabi...."

Even if it's really hot outside you won't really feel it because of the a/c from the restaurant.\n\nWe arrived around 10 am and were seated promptly. The server was efficient and friendly during our stay. That morning we ordered the eggs benedict, smoked salmon eggs benedict, chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat), two mimosa's, and an orange juice. It didn't take very long for our food and drinks to arrive at our table. The eggs benedict were delicious! The mimosa's were quite expensive at $11.50 USD whereas we can get them for about $5 in Canada. Our server didn't charge us for the orange juice as she assumed we would use it for our mimosa's.\n\nBesides the pricey mimosa's we would definitely return on our next visit to Vegas."

Our meal started with a complimentary wrapped baguette for the table. All our choices were perfect: The Chicken Mushroom Crepe, served with a salad, was light - but hearty and delicious . Next time, I would ask them to skip the chicken and add extra mushrooms. The fries were the best I've ever tasted. Had a taste of the Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi - and was like nothing I've ever had before. Our accommodating server offered artichokes to replace Canadian bacon in order to make the brunch Eggs Benedict vegetarian for one in our party.\n\nFor simple, casual food, Mon Ami Gabi gets my 5 stars."

Which is why the line for this place is out the door. Even Open Table reservations get you indoor seating. But to truly enjoy this venue, you'll have to wait over an hour to snag a patio seat.\n\nHowever, we chose our bellies over our eyes and sat indoors, which was very pleasant, although a bit too dimly lit.\n\nThe service was impeccable, definitely a solid 5-stars there. The menu was eclectic and offered tons of delicious and unique choices. Needless to say, we enjoyed every moment of our meal here.\n\nI had to dock one star reluctantly because the one item we came here for, the steak, barely met our expectations, instead of wow-ing us.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, which was cooked a perfect medium-rare, yet lacked the flavorful taste you expect from a 5-star steakhouse. Same thing can be about the Bordelaise, which my girlfriend ordered.\n\nThe apps, wine, and homemade bread, were spectacular. We will come back and give the steak another chance. A gorgeous place like this deserves it.\n\n---\n\nDistinguishing factor: Probably one of the most romantic patio seating you'll find in the glittering hub that is Las Vegas."

We sat outside right at where the indoors and patio meet and were able to see the Bellagio water show, which was cool.\n\nI never give a restaurant 5 stars because there is always something to be proved upon.

She had no idea and put us at a table in full sun that was inside. We waited almost 10 minutes to even be acknowledged after we sat. My bf got the bloody mary bar options to make his own. He really liked it but when he went up for a second time they had already taken the bar away and our server said nothing to us knowing he wanted to go up more than once. We had to constantly ask for water refills and the water was sitting in a metal pitcher which meant the water was Luke warm. No ice. The food was ok. The French onion soup was good but the French Toast was nothing special. Our server Jessica stood around at the bar chatting with another server while we waited for service. My last gripe is I ordered a cappuccino which was served to me in the smallest cup ever. It was 3 sips and way too expensive. I will not be going back."

I'm pretty sure that's what i got, or it felt like that's the kind of cut i received.  I'm being honest here.\n\nOur waitress was also judgmental.  and not the best servant. perhaps because we didn't go for an expensive wine.  Also we had our cameras with us... so we probably looked like tourists... nonetheless service was DISMAL!

I really should have ordered my steak medium rare, because I didn't realize how thin of a slice the steak was going to be and ended up coming out kind of dry.

Being the first person to set an impression on customers in such a fine restaurant you would think she would have better greeting skills. We were then taken to our table by another host who not only didn't say one word to us while we were walking to the patio dining but walked so fast we actually lost him going through the restaurant. Only positive experience about the whole entry and seating was our table was in a great spot on the patio with a great view. \n\nWe were then greeted by our server who I would say switched up my negative outlook thus far. She was friendly, personable and attentive. We enjoyed the salmon and Florentine Benedict. Both were very good, the eggs were poached just right topped with a rich Hollandaise sauce.  We then enjoyed a banana foster crepe for dessert. \n\nThe dining experience I would give a 4, the food a 4 and the hostess team a -1\n\nBe careful too if your wearing black because the napkins leave lint all over your clothes.

We were visiting on a Sunday, so I assumed that a full Sunday brunch would be in order. \n\nThere was very little wait at 11 am, however when we sat down we were presented with a minimal brunch menu of about 5-6 different items and no breakfast style cocktails (I probably could have asked for a Bloody Mary or Mimosa if I wanted, but neither was featured on the menu.) I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had the Corned Beef and Hash. The food was fine; nothing spectacular about either dish. It was definitely an expensive brunch which I would not recommend to anyone. I am curious to try dinner, however, after suck a lackluster performance at brunch I am hesitant. \n\nOur wait staff was about average; nothing wrong, but nothing great, however the table next to us had a very negative experience and voiced this quite loudly, asking to see the manager and retelling how the waiter had \"failed\" at their service while he stood off to the side, which was really awkward.

The steak frites are good but don't try to reheat them, they just aren't the same :("

  "text" : "There's not many other spots on the strip that could rival this place for people watching over a yummy breakfast!  The fact that the spot is so great does make Mon Ami VERY busy especially on a weekend (be prepared for an hour long wait at least) and, frustratingly the buzzer they give you to alert you when your table is ready only works if you're in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant which rules out a wander around the shops to kill the time!  Once you're in the food is pretty good and the fresh bread they serve is a lovely addition.  My husband and I tried a few dishes on the menu including steak and eggs (which my husband raved about), goats cheese omelet (which was very tasty) and blueberry waffles (could have been better).  Overall I'd definitely recommend having breakfast or brunch here at least once during your trip but maybe avoid weekends!!"

  "text" : "I expected much from this restaurant, after having read all the reviews here on Yelp and also talking to my neighbors and friends, who visit Vegas a lot. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed. But there was still room for improvement. Let me explain....\n\nHubby and I came here for my bday and our anniversary dinner (yes, same date. I wanted to make sure he never forgot! LOL), on July 7th. We initially made reservations for the main dining room but, after further review, I decided to cancel that and instead dine out on the much-lauded patio (they don't take reservations for patio seating). After seeing an amazing show, we came here and were told there was a 45 minute wait. We were given a light-up timer disc. In exactly 45 minutes, it lit up like a Christmas tree. Exactly 45 minutes, to the minute. Uncanny. \n\nOur hostess who seated us was lovely as can be. She wished us a happy anniversary and me, a happy bday. \n\nWe were seated under a heat lamp outside. It was chilly and I was freezing. I saw some of our neighbors at adjacent tables rubbing their arms, too, and one family was soon seated at a nearby table, only to tell the hostess soon after that it was too cold for them and they left to be seated inside. So... Ami staff, please up the heat on chilly nights! Thank you!\n\nIt was amazing watching the Bellagio fountain show while we dined. Dinner and a show! It was wonderful.\n\nThe server who brought our waters and bread was great. He took some photos of us and wished us a happy anniversary/bday as well!\n\nOh and the bread! Wow. A real French baguette, \"served\" in a baguette bag, freshly baked and oh so warm, perfectly baked with crusty exterior and warm and soft inside. You just want to dive right in. Seriously delicious.\n\nOur server was a distinguished gentleman who initially seemed somewhat dour and aloof, not smiling and making minimal eye contact. My hubby thought him pretentious but I warmed up to him and saw him smiling a bit a few times. He promptly took our orders and he was somewhat attentive. He never wished us a happy celebratory day, though (unlike the rest of the folks who worked our table).\n\nWe ordered the seafood tower to share and it was fantastic! Lobster and oysters and huge shrimp and a wonderful ceviche and more. What a treat. \n\nWe were too full for dessert, although the dessert menu looked divine. I had some Earl Grey tea. While paying the bill, we saw another waiter go by with some treat/dessert with a lit candle in it, rushing to bring it to another table's celebrant. My hubby and I looked at each other and simultaneously thought the same petty thought: why them and not us??? I know it's a minor issue, and we were both too full for dessert, but the restaurant staff knew it was a special date for my hubby and me - a doubly special date. Why no celebratory cupcake or whatever they were giving out? Just seemed inequitable. Petty, yes. But strange inconsistency nonetheless. This didn't negate in any way from the lovely meal we had here, but it still was off-putting somewhat."

  "text" : "This is a really cute French restaurant at Paris Hotel & Casino.  It sits outside of the hotel facing the Bellagio fountains.  We made a reservation and needed to add an additional person at the last minute and actually wanted to eat earlier, and not only were the hosts able to accommodate to our group size, but we also got sat 15 minutes before our reservation time.  We were sat in the inside with the air-conditioning, but right next to the patio where we were able to view the Bellagio fountain show from our seats.  It was spectacular.  \n\nWe were a group of 7 and brought our own wine bottles.  Corkage fee is $30 per bottle, which is a bit steep, even for Vegas.  They served us complimentary baguettes with butter and some carrot dish,  Our server was very friendly and explained the menu to us in detail.  \n\nWe ended up ordering a few appetizers:\n-Oysters: Unfortunately I didn't get to try these.  I love oysters too.\n-Some Goat Cheese App with Toasted Garlic Bread: This was delicious!  Whatever the goat cheese was mixed with was very good, not too salty, and had the right amount of goat cheese\n-Escargots: This was drench in some olive oil and basil sauce that was very good.  I ate the whole snail and I used the same sauce to dip the complimentary baguettes.\n\nMain dish:\n-Hangar Steak ($23): So tender!!!  This came with some merlot butter sauce that really went well with the steak.  It was very rich in flavor and was like a dream in my mouth.  I had my steak with haricots verts instead of fries since I ate like a pig at lunch.  \n-Filet Merlot: I had a bite of this.  It's an 8 oz steak, which is their smallest size, and it was the most tender filet ever!  It was soft like butter.  You could probably cut it with a fork. This meat was also rich in flavor and their most popular steak frites dish. \n-Bison Rib-eye (Special of the Day about $40): I had a taste of this also.  It was very good, lean-tasting, and not gamey at all.\n\nDessert:\n-Banana fosters Crepe ($10.95): I probably could have devoured this by myself despite being super full.  This was not too sweet and had all the right flavors combined, plus a scoop of vanilla ice cream wrapped in the middle.\n-Caramel Creme Brulee: Though not as good as the Banana Fosters Crepe, this was also really tasty.  Crepe Brulee with a hint of caramel.  The carmelized sugar was perfectly burnt and not too hard to break through.      \n\nOverall, this was a very hearty and delicious meal.  I left feeling super stuffed.  Everything on the menu tasted very good and the service was impeccable.  Highly recommended, especially if you're staying close by!"

  "text" : "HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n\nAtmosphere 1 star\nService 1.5 Stars\nFood 1.5 Stars\nPrice Value vs Food Quality 1 Star\n\nI had the pleasure of dining here this past week with four co-workers during a business trip to Vegas. Yes you can do business in Vegas between the entertainment and adventures lol.\n\nOverall absolutely great place to eat. I highly recommend and I will return next time I am in Vegas.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nThe inside is just a little dark with low lighting which was ok but hard to see the menu for some people. They also have outside seating if you wanted that. Might be nice not in July for me personally. The seating was comfortable and the tables were large enough for all of our meals and sides. The interior is designed very well with an little old school steakhouse feel with dark woods and light colored furnishings. It was a very comfortable but upscale French Steakhouse.\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was absolutely amazing. I wish I had written his name down as I did not have to pay this bill (thank goodness! 5 big guys in a steakhouse is not cheap). The server had a french accent which was neat it added to the atmosphere. He was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the foods. He was also a really good salesmen as well taking opportunities to up sell or add on sell us. He did it in a fun way that tied into our group and our conversations. He did not do it in a cheesy or pushy way it was pretty cool. We all joked we should have him working in our store but he make to much money working here lol. GREAT SERVICE! \n\nFOOD\nWe skipped the appetizers this trip as we were in a hurry for dinner. However, they do have this bread in a bag with butter they give it. The bread was very good. Crispy outside, soft and warm inside and plenty for the table. \n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had the 22 oz bone on ribeye with a bearnaise sauce and these little strips of potato. The steak was cooked perfect and one of the top steaks I ever eaten in my life. The right amount of fat, texture, and natural beef flavor the light seasoning pulled out was amazing. The flavor was great already and then the sauce was great for dipping. They also have different sauces you can have your steak with as well. I just love bearnaise sauce.\n\nWe also shared a few sides. The sauteed mushrooms were good. The others tried the roasted potato carrots and enjoyed them. I did not try them. The one side that was better than expect was the cauliflower potato mash. Very good when its warm just like all cooked cauliflower mashes when they get cold not so good. This was great though! \n\nMy peers had hanger steaks and filet mignon and all were outstanding. We did not have a bad thing on our table. \n\nThey also had a huge selection of alcohol and wines which we did not sample to provide feedback.\n\nPRICE VALUE VS FOOD QUALITY \nThis is a medium priced steakhouse for Las Vegas. The prices can be high in Vegas as everyone knows who has traveled there. However, the food quality and portion size for the price is absolutely reasonable and well worth the stay. Our same meal at another steakhouse that week was almost double and the food was actually better here."

And the frites (fries) were cold and dried out tasting.  They added nothing to the meal.  We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms which were cold and way under seasoned.  I'd been to this restaurant many years ago, and I remember it being better quality.  We'll probably skip this place next time we are at the Paris for a show."

The menu has changed slightly and they no longer have the baked Brie, but they do have some fun new stuff like a \"pulled pork bahn mi\" (not very French, but it was tasty). \n\nSteak frites is always a safe option and it comes with a variety of sauces to choose from. My favorite is still the au poirve, which is the peppercorn brandy sauce. The baguette they serve you is very tasty and I try very hard to not fill up on it, but how can you owe up a hot and fresh baguette?\n\nThe country pate is also quite yummy but mild in flavor, which I don't mind. It comes with area pieces of toasty bread, whole grain mustard, a few sprigs of fresh watercress, and well as a variety of pickled items. It's a yummy starter to share, but a little much to eat all on your own as a starter. \n\nDecent French food on the strip with a magnificent view of Bellagio's water show.

  "text" : "This is one of the BEST restaurants in Vegas. The boyfriend and I came here and loved everything we ate. We ordered: \n\nsteak sandwich medium - probably the best steak sandwich I've ever had. I had no idea a steak sandwich could taste so good. And it went with the dip so well. The bread is soft enough to be chewed on, but hard enough to not get all soggy once dipped. \nchicken and mushroom crepe - delicious flavors in this crepe. It had brie cheese, which made it all the much better. \nsalmon tartare - The salmon tartare was delicious and fresh, with nice crunchy chips and avocado. \nfrench onion soup - Delicious french onion soup with the beautiful layer of cheese on top. I think the only good memories I have of great french onion soup has been in Vegas. \n\nThe seating was perfect. We asked to be seated outdoors, but we weren't placed literally outside. Instead, we were still under an air conditioned glass room, where we had an outdoor view of the poor passerbys suffering the hot sun. We got the best of both worlds. \n\nOur server wasn't the best. She was rude and inattentive, but the food was so good I couldn't care less. \n\nI'd come back."

  "text" : "Located next to the Eiffel tower and across the street from Bellagio, this restaurant has the perfect view of people watching while enjoying some good food. We came by for brunch and wanted to sit outside so we had to wait about 15 minutes. The restaurant got a lot busier after we sat down though so there might be a longer wait than that. Our waitress was friendly and I thought service was great. \n\nI ordered the three eggs plate which also had bacons, hash browns, and toasts. The eggs were cooked right and they were perfectly round. The bacons were thick which were good but I prefer my bacons on the thinner side. The toasts tasted great with the jam and white butter/cream! The jam was not too sweet and had a rich fruity flavor to it. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash which was presented nicely on the plate. The meat tasted so good, so soft, and so juicy.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. They have good coffee to keep you awake so you can stay awake and gamble all day long."

Although it is mostly a steak house, there are also chicken, fish, vegetarian, and other options. They also have a lot of excellent sides and bring out gluten free bread with the meal with the other normal bread. All of my plates had a little stick that read \"allergy\" so I know for a fact the chef's prepared it gluten free and it wouldn't be mixed up. This restaurant is a little pricey but is so worth it for the care they take with my gluten allergy and the taste of the food! Easily the best restaurant on the strip."

Service was friendly and snappy.  Croissants were divine, as were other pastries and bread.  An order of quiche produced a whole pie that was delicious.  Muesli was fresh and very good according to our healthy focused teen.  The skinny lemon pancake with mint syrup was sweet, a bit savory and free from too much guilt.  A lovely dining experience.  With my husband a bit sick, he ordered the Emergen-C and to our delight came orange juice, fresh mint, an orange shell filled with fresh orange segments and a packet of Emergen-C!  The presentation alone would send someone on the road to recovery!  All in all, an unforgettable dining experience."

  "text" : "By far the best meal we had during our 3 days in sin city!  Mon Ami Gabi exceeded our expectations in every way possible.  Since I knew that we would be making a trip to Las Vegas, I yelped the highest rated restaurants on the strip and MAG came up in the top feed.  Coincidentally, the other half decided to make a dinner reservation for us there.  It had to be fate.  \n\nHaving passed by MAG a few times while walking on the strip, you truly get the vibe of a French Bistro with the outdoor seating and decor.  Once inside, it's quite romantic with dim lighting and charming ambiance.  We opted to sit inside since it was still upper 90 degree temperatures out on the patio.  They do have misters, but I think I prefer not to have my food misted.  Inside was perfect as we had our table for two set up in a more private corner, but still able to see the outdoor patio.  Our waiter, though professional, was a little dry in the beginning but warmed up a bit throughout service.  Our food came out with perfect timing.  Service was on point.  We were checked on periodically and our glasses were always filled.  \n\nBeing a sucker for any type of fresh baked bread, I pretty much ate the majority of the French baguette that was served with a carrot type slaw and butter.  I've never been to France before, so I'm not sure if they always serve their breads with this carrot slaw.  It reminded us of a Ban Mi and I suppose that's one way of French influence in Vietnamese cuisine?  Either way, that baguette was damn good and we had to refrain ourselves from having another when the waiter asked if we wanted more.  We didn't want to fill ourselves up with bread before dinner.  \n\nThe waiter was patient and let me try the pinot noir and cabernet from the rolling wine cart before settling on the bordeux ($11/glass).  They have an extensive wine list and lots of wonderful options listed as well as a fancy cocktail menu. \n\nThe cooking and execution at MAG really shines.  Everything we ordered that was perfectly prepared, had delicious flavors and nice presentation.  Most impressive was that every single dish was a hit! \n-Mussels Mariniere ($12.95/half order):  By far the best mussels we have ever had!  The mussels were tender and just cooked to perfection.  Most times they are overcooked and somewhat chewy.  We thought we had the best mussels in NY's Flex Mussels but MAG really impressed.  The herb wine sauce was also so good we used the remaining french bread to sop it all up.  For a half order, generous portion and a great appetizer to start with. \n-Skate Wing ($25.95):  Being an adventurous eater, I wanted to give it a try since I've never had it before.  I must say, it was moist, tender and a flavorful white fish.  The way it was prepared was delicious - pan fried golden brown on the outside.  It was served on a bed of white asparagus and baby asparagus.  Veggies were fresh and blanched just right.  I asked for the Hollandaise sauce on the side since I normally think it's too thick and heavy.  However, the MAG Hollandaise was light and delicate (probably as it should be) and amazingly delicious!  Best Hollandaise vert we've ever had! \n-New York Strip ($37.95):  Wherever he goes, he must have his steak and frites.  The other half ordered it medium and it came out medium.  The steak was a good size and came with a huge pile or thinly hand cut fries.  I tried a piece of the steak and it was tender with simple flavors of garlic, salt and pepper.  The steak didn't even need the bordelaise sauce that it came with.  Fries weren't too greasy or salty.  \n-Classic Profiteroles ($9.95):  My favorite dessert of all time!  Not too many places serve profiteroles, so whenever I see them on the menu I must order, no matter how stuffed I am. MAG profiteroles were also the best I've ever had.  They were decadent and sinful.  Three large pastry puffs with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between each puff with double dark chocolate fudge drizzled on top - I was in heaven!!!  Highly highly recommend! \nOverall one of the best meals I've had from start to finish in a very long time.  Total tab was $135 for two.  Very reasonable prices, great value, spectacular dining experience without being pretentious, nice wait staff, excellent cooking and very enjoyable food!"

And for gf breakfast options they have gf french toast and regular gf toast that comes with the egg dishes! The bacon and hash browns were pretty good, pretty standard but overall it was a very satisfying breakfast. The ambiance is cute and very French. At first we were seated outside, but as soon as we sat down varies staff members warned us that our table would get very hot very quickly since there was hardly any shade on it. We moved inside. Its a little noisy inside, I would suggest sitting on the patio if you can get a shaded spot, that way you can watch the Bellagio fountain."

I enjoyed my Frangria while my friend was served with their bloody mary bar. Our first plate was the mussels, which was cooked in a creamy and rich sauce. It was perfect! Definitely one of the best mussels that I have had. It was followed by my main entree, chicken and mushroom crepe. The crepe was also excellent. The filling of mushroom and chicken was well balanced with the light creamy sauce. The crepe was thin but flavorful. Overall, we all enjoyed our plates and were ready for our Vegas trip. The location of this place is also a selling point. It is right across from the fountain of Bellagio.

Unfortunately, we were running late so had to change our reservation from 6 to 6:45.  When we arrived, the line was quite long, so it took about 10 minutes to get to the hostess desk.  As soon as we got to the front, however, they took us right back to our table.  The dining room is a bit crowded, but beautiful.  The ambiance is still romantic.\n\nAs we perused the menu, our waitress (Shana) noticed that we were a little rushed.  Our limo was scheduled to pick us up for the next event at 8PM (it was 7:15 by this time).  She took our orders and said she would have the kitchen rush so that we could be out in time.  We were absolutely amazed when we got our food a few minutes later.  There was quite a bit of diversity in the orders - steak, chicken, pasta, etc. and everything was cooked perfectly still.  Every girl raved about their dish, and the quality.  Special thank you to the kitchen staff.  Shana and her assistants kept our drinks full and went above and beyond to make sure that we had a wonderful experience, even though rushed.  She was able to split our checks 9 ways and we made it in time to meet our driver outside at 8PM.  \n\nThe french bread was served in a cute paper bag, with butter, and this flavorful carrot garnish.  I opted for the chicken grand-mere which came with pommes puree.  Again, cooked perfectly with the perfect complement of flavors and spices.  Usually, a French restaurant is not my first choice when dining in Vegas, but I'm sure I will be back to sit and enjoy the complete meal and experience."

We were seated in their glass pavilion looking out to the strip. Great location since we get the view w/o the smoke.\n\nWe ordered the Maine Lobster Roll and the Classic Quiche Lorraine and both came out above expectation. The lobster roll looks a little small but it's actually quite filling. The lobster was buttery and complemented well with the salad and the vinaigrette. There's nothing special about the fries and a little more lobster meat would have been nice. My wife loves quiche and this is one of the best she's ever had. That's high compliments from her.\n\nOverall, this was a nice pit stop for us to refuel before continuing with our planned activities for the rest of the afternoon.

FOR.....I can't even bring myself to try other dishes on their menu. The chocolate mousse is also delicious and my mother in law loved their creme brulee.  Obviously since its on the strip, its busy. Make sure you make a reservation and sit outside if you can! You won't regret dining here!"

When I filtered through the Yelp search for most reviewed and ratings, both times Mon Ami Gabi popped up in Las Vegas. \n\nMy party and I got here around 8AM and was hoping to get a patio table but the line for the patio was way too long, so we opted for indoors! Our wait was only around 15 minutes or so. Our table was a nice surprise to me- it was actually outdoors with a roof shade over it. So that was nice. We still got a view of the Bellagio Fountain and the Strip. \n\nOur server was nice and patient with us. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was AMAZING. The hollandaise sauce was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right! Not to mention their hash browns are so yummy! \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to everyone; it's kid friendly as well!"

  "text" : "I brought my 9 year old niece visiting from Florida who aspires to be a French chef and travel to Paris someday. It was evident we were struggling with an order for the child and at no time was a children's menu offered so I ended up ordering a salad, two sides and a basic classique steak.  She did not care for the salad bc she is young and the vinaigrette dressing was so strong (I loved it) so I got online to look for a restaurant that would cater to children better.  I ended up seeing on google the children's menu for mon ami. Really? Why on earth wouldn't you OFFER the menu when I'm sitting with a 9 yr old and I was asking twenty questions about seasoning etc to make the meal kid friendly. The bill was $80 and I could have had a better experience at Outback. The waitress was too busy with the larger parties to give us the service we deserved. I'm a local and mom ami used to be my favorite date spot or special lunch and I am sorely disappointed. I ended up asking for the children's menu options which my niece was pleased with but this was far too difficult for such a pricey meal my niece was so excited I was disappointed.  Pass on eating here again."

If you are a vegetarian, then this is not the place for you: they only have two vegetarian dishes.

We made reservations early but by the time we arrived all the outside sitting (in front of the Bellagio Fountains) were all taken. The staff is very friendly and professional. They had some excellent wine selection. The menu has a great variety of steaks. I had the bison ribeye which wasn't on the menu but it was on the specials of the day. \nThe bread they bring you is really good so are the spreading dips!! I didn't get any soup because I was saving some room for dessert!! But everybody that had one commented how good the French onion soup was. \nWhen the main course arrived oh my gosh!! I didn't think I was going to be able to eat all that meat but I did and I was glad I didn't get any other side because I don't think I could possibly eat something else. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Good flavor, really tender and so tasty! It was definitely one of the best Bison steaks I have ever had. \nI could not leave this restaurant without trying their banana crepe with ice cream. It's delicious!! I do recommend to split it. This restaurant it's great! Excellent food quality and service. Call in early and make reservations so that you can see the fountain show."

What's not to love about a charming Parisian style bistro for a spot of brunch? \n\nThe atmosphere here is the best, the closest I've seen to France outside of the country itself. The service was quite fast but extremely courteous.\n\nThere is a wide selection of fresh espresso ($4), coffee ($4), orange juice ($4) and other juices, as well as a well procured drink list that I didn't partake in so early, even though people nearby definitely were.\n\nFor a light meal, I chose the yogurt parfait ($5.95) and pan au chocolat ($4). The parfait was made fresh, and not something that had sat in a fridge somewhere. The pan au chocolat was fresh baked, and tasted like it was fresh out of the oven, still warm with a slight chew. I believe it had some caramelized sugar on it, but all in all it was delightful.\n\nOverall a great place, and probably my favorite in all the places I stopped at in Vegas."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi (literally \"my friend Gabi\") is French enough to have a charming, inviting interior and some great food, but not so French that it pisses you right off.  This place hits the mark and the prices, even for Vegas, are shockingly in the same zip code as \"reasonable.\"\n\nThe inside has dark paneling, flowers in vases, thoroughly-appointed place settings, and some rather corny overly-French signage (like \"Au Revoir\" over the exit haha).  The staff are hit and miss, but they do give it a good ole' college try.\n\nThe food is quite respectable, even if the menu offers a lot of items that just seem French-ish to most people rather than what you'd find in a Parisian restaurant.  The crepes are excellent across the board, the quiche lorraine is fluffy and decadent, and the breakfast dishes are delicious and filling.  On Saturdays and Sundays they offer a ridiculously-stocked bloody Mary bar that is the perfect antidote to the ubiquitous Vegas hangover.\n\nThere are some obviously Vegas-like departures from French dining of course; our waiter for instance had badly chapped lips, stammered a lot while trying to remember the specials, and at one point wiped his nose with the back of his hand; all three of which are offenses that would get him fired on the spot from any decent eatery on the Champs-Élysées.  None of this was offensive to us, we're Americans with perennially low expectations for Vegas, and as I implied at the start: departure from 100% authentic French is not necessarily a bad thing."

We had a lacklustre experience here. Even though the restaurant was not full, the food took forever. The   baguette was warm and crusty, delicious. We also got the baked goat cheese which was rich and decadent with garlic bread. The goat cheese sat in a dish of tomato bisque, prefect for dipping. But that was all that was good. \nWe got the recommended Chicken Paillard, a pounded pan fried chicken breast sitting on a supposed basil aioli send with salad. First, the chicken was underseasoned. And the basil aioli was not what it was supposed to be. It was very bitter with only a slight hint of some herb. When we told or server that it was bitter, she reiterated what it was supposed to be and walked away. The salad had greens and pickled beets which were extremely sour. \nI got the recommended wild boar ragu cencioni pasta. The pasta was good and the ragu was ok. Nothing to wrote home about and certainly not worth  the pricing."

I love my dish and found the extra crispy frites (read: chips) to be a pleasure to eat. My girlfriend didn't so much enjoy her dish. She said the french dip was too long and thin and the fries too crispy. I guess you can't please everyone.

Ambiance is themed pretty well and even better if you can get a seating at the outdoor patio area to overlook Las Vegas Blvd and The Bellagio Fountains. It is also a romantic atmosphere when  you dine at night. The restaurant is dimmed...perfect candlelight light dinner. (it may be too dark for some since I saw a few people use their flashlights on their phone to look at the menu....lol)\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the \"Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale\" to share. The salad consist of avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing. Big enough portion to count as an entrée. Everything on that plate was fresh.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Au Poivre Steak with Brandy peppercorn sauce. He's a steak connoisseur so of course he would think this was \"okay, I've had better.\" Well of course he would think it tasted ok because he eats at Delmonico's and Carnevino regularly but that's besides the point. (sorry hun....I had to throw that out there! Don't get mad! =) )\n\nFor my entrée, I ordered one of their Specials of the Day. It was seared trout (I asked to make sure it cooked well done) with a few roasted potatoes and carrots in the mix. It also included a portion of shell pasta with a light pesto sauce. (see pic attached.) Hands down I would order this again."

I always say you can judge a restaurant by the quality of their bread...in this case it's top quality. They serve a large warm fresh baguette right to your table. The best part is how the food is not only deliciously savory, but the prices are outstanding for a restaurant of such quality. Consider the divine nicoise fish. Save room for desert!"

Had to wait an hour for an outside table but it was so worth the wait (minus the annoying costumed characters harassing tourists on the strip). The escargots were perfect, just like I had in France. I wished they had a bread shop because I'd buy those baguettes and take them home. I had a craving for the steak au jus sandwich and my waiter, Manny told me that item is on the lunch menu but they made it for me anyway. I really appreciated that and it happened to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I'm just sorry I didn't have room for dessert. Next time, I'm going to have to try the brunch!"

We got just about everything off the menu and not one thing was less than superb.\n\nTheir portions are giant, you will definitely not leave hungry. For breakfast, our favorites were their mixed berry pancakes and the Nutella filled waffles. Their homemade whipped cream is to die for. I also got a bowl of cappuccino, which was a great deal for the price and delicious. Their eggs were cooked perfectly and our waitress was so sweet.\n\nFor dinner our waiter, Billy, was so much fun. He recommended great things off the menu and paired a lovely wine with my Filet. We each got a steak, all probably the best we have had, and a few different dipping sauces. My sauce preference was the Roquefort one. \n\nWe were a group of five and the place was packed both times we came, yet we were seated immediately. Our appetizers came within ten minutes of ordering and our entrees within twenty.\n\nWe will most definitely be returning here the next time we visit Vegas."

The bartenders here are fabulous.  We had not been to Gabi's bar in a couple of years, yet on our most recent visit, one of the bartenders remembered us, where we were from and even our favorite drinks.  He should get an act like David Copperfield!  Anyway, it's always great to be treated like a regular, especially in Vegas.\n\nThis time around, we decided to have dinner and asked for a table.  I accidentally spilled what was left of my drink (about a third) as we were being seated.  Our server promptly brought me another one at no charge.  We both ordered the filet mignon and were not disappointed.  Both were cooked perfectly tender, with a delicious red wine reduction on top, although the steaks really didn't need any embellishment.  They could easily have stood on their own.  Some crispy potato strings were served up alongside and we also ordered some sauteed mushrooms.  Both service and food were excellent.  Mrs. Mongo and I will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi, I hyped you up way too much in my head. I almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow Yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \n\nFirst off, our waiter was super rude! I guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. Our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, I probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\n\nNow onto the meal, I ended up ordering the filet mignon merlot $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, salmon tartare, shrimp cocktail (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. Now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. The filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with I could've done without. The seafood platter was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the salmon tartare needed something more. I guess it's hard to compare when I've only had salmon tartare in Portugal. \n\nFor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme brûlée which was amazing. The dessert was 5 star worthy! If you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \n\nOverall, this place wasn't bad. Perhaps I came on an off day. I don't think I'd come back to the same waiter if I dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!"

Even during the busy breakfast to lunch transition the background noises did not ruin the atmosphere.\n\nOur server was very attentive, making sure or water and coffee were always topped-off. He was very pleasant and made some very good recommendations.\n\nThe corned beef hash was delicious, and it was actual corned beef, not the canned variety you find in a lot of place. This made my wife a little apprehensive since she's only had real corned beef once and want a fan, but the taste of the corned beef was on point. The hash brown plate that came along was pretty standard.\n\nThe waiter also recommended the bacon, I've never been to a place where the bacon was something to recommend, it's always been a pretty standard breakfast side dish, but this bacon was something else. It was thick, and a little sweet and perfectly cooked.\n\nThe \"pancakes\" where the low point. They're not really pancakes. They waiter mentioned they were like crepes, but as far as I'm concerned they WERE crepes, large and thin. They were a little bland, even with the butter cinnamon topping, but their whipped cream made everything better."

The only downfall with this restaurant is that the seating is very over crowded. You are seated one on top of the other. We dined on a Saturday night and it was very busy, which is to be expected for a restaurant perched on Las Vegas boulevard. It seem as though the restaurant was focused on \"turning and burning\" tables. Average dinning time for other French bistros is a lot longer. We had a party of 4 and with appetizers and dinner we were out in less then an hour. Good if you want to get in a meal before a show. \nThe service was outstanding. Although the restaurant in my opinion was focussed on room turnover our waiter still took the time to help walk is through the menu. Overall good experience just really busy and very noisy."

There was no wait although the restaurant was quite busy. \nThere were misters in the patio to keep us cool as well as umbrellas, I ordered a mimosa and my fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary. The mimosa was delicious, and the Bloody Mary my fiancé came back with from the DIY bloody bar encouraged me to order one as well. \nWe began our meals with chicken liver pâté and a smoked salmon plate. The pâté was very rich but delicious and the smoked salmon was divine. I ended up eating just the salmon and capers as the toasts it was served with began to fill me up a bit. \nAfter our appetizers we got a Croque Madame with frites. The Gruyere on the Madame was so delicious and the sunny side up egg soaked into the bread perfectly. all I could hear were angels singing. The frites were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. \nIt was a delicious French brunch, I would say it's family friendly restaurant as long as your children are well behaved."

We were seated inside on a Wednesday evening.  It was definitely crowded but not overpacked.  The atmosphere was trendy and the mood was rather romantic (a la francaise, biensur) and we had a lovely view of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip! Overall, we had a fantastic time! Our server was very nice and attentive, as were his assistants.  I began the evening with my favorite beverage - a French martini.  It was made just the way it should be! (I've definitely had some less than stellar French martinis before).  For the appetizers, I ordered the escargot.  The green sauce it came in was UNBELIEVABLE! Probably one of our favorite parts of the meal! The bread was delicious and warm, and we kept dipping it in the green escargot sauce - SO GOOD!\n\nBefore the main course, we ordered some red wine.  Unfortunately, I do not remember exactly what that wine was, but it was a French red, middle priced - very good! I ordered the steak frites dijon - delicieux! I like my meat cooked medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection! We ordered sides of sautéed mushrooms and asparagus - brilliant as well!\n\nFrankly, we were just too full to order dessert...but since it was my birthday, the server brought out a lovely piece of chocolate cake with \"Happy Birthday\" written on it! I loved the personalized touch - little details like that mean a lot! I will definitely return soon! Perhaps I'll try the cheese platter as well next time:-) Thank you Gabi for a wonderful birthday evening!"

When there I always sneak a bite off everyone's plate.  Take the risk of a hand slap from your dining partners.   The reward is worth it. \n\n1 downside and deduction was that they have too many tables crammed onto the patio.   I think there used to be more room.  I would've opted for inside seating had I known we would be chair tilting into people all around.\n\nStill a solid 4 and I'm glad to see this now Vegas staple is still doing well."

I've been eating here for special occasions for at least 14 years or so.\n\nThat being said, I found last night's dinner to only be OK. My group started with the French Onion Soup, the gazpacho special, and the Baked Goat Cheese Salad. The gazpacho was great! The soup was a touch too sweet and the salad, frankly, was not worth it. One circle of cheese on top of greens. For $14.\n\nI found my steak to be good, but not great. In my mind the steaks have always been great so I'm not sure what happened. The fries, very sadly, were a touch over cooked. \n\nOur dessert was the caramel creme brulee and it was divine! Excellent! Our server was also very friendly.\n\nAll of this being said, \"OK\" at Mon Ami Gabi is \"great\" anywhere else. I just have so many perfect meals in my memory that last night's meal didn't quite match up."

  "text" : "So my friends and I were in town for the Electric Daisy Carnival and decided to go exploring for some amazing eats. We stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant after passing through the Bellagio. We were quite severely underdressed (party clothes) but the staff were friendly and accomodating for us anyways.\n\nThe decor is cool. They have the indoor dimly-lit dining room/area, an adjacent glass-view area and a conjoined outdoor patio from there. Very spacious and clean.\n\nA whole meal on avg will be $20-40 as someone has probably already pointed out. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a chilled lobster bisque as I recall. It was creamy and full of crustaceany flavour. Some of my friends ordered the french onion soup and I tried some of it.  It was also divine.\n\nSeeing that this restaurant had an awesome rating out of 5000+ reviews and I was starving, I figured \"yolo\" and proceeded to order the most expensive item on the menu. That would be the 22 oz bone-in ribeye with bearnaise sauce and frites which costs $40. My steak was cooked perfectly (I asked for medium rare) and my fries were nice and crispy. To top it all off, the bearnaise complimented everything beautifully. I sound silly saying this, but it was possibly the best bearnaise I have ever tasted so far lol.\n\nUnfortunately I've already forgotten our server's name but he was amazing. We got complimentary bread and carrot slaw and our drinks were always refilled without asking. A group gratuity of 18% was already included in the total bill but we decided to tip on top of that simply because we felt he deserved it.\n\nFinal rating = 4.5/5 stars. Was it overpriced slightly? Hell yes. Was it worth it? I think so??? Would I come back? Hell yes. It loses 0.5 stars simply for the insane price. Fantastic meal nevertheless."

  "text" : "My fiance and I came here based on a recommendation from friends that had just visited this summer.  This place isn't THEE finest restaurant in all of Las Vegas, considering our entire experience on the whole, giving it any less than 5Stars would have been unjust (and in comparison to restaurants considered \"fine dining\" this totally blew a lot of them away)\n\nFirst, our wait. My fiance and I made 8pm reservations and still had to wait about 45min-1hr for our requested patio seating.  We didn't mind at all though- it was expected and I did my homework before making any reservations on the strip anyway.  We hung at the bar facing the Bellagio and just talked.  Fiance had a great IPA beer and the bartender kept my water glass full.\n\nWe were then seated at a nice sized table on the patio, originally set for 4guests, so we weren't crammed onto a small table that barely fit 2 plates.  However, there was a big umbrella blocking our view of the water show at the Ballagio, so I asked our maitre'd  if we could hop to the next table that just paid their check and left- he was more than happy to accommodate that, and we just moved over a table.  We now had the perfect, most romantic view.  Our waitress (and even the waiter in the next section over to us) were so highly accommodating, friendly, helpful with menu choices and info, and so attentive.  \n\nWe ordered the mussels as an appetizer, which weren't typically my style- I always prefer a clear broth or marinara style of mussels, but Mon Ami Gabi is a french flair cuisine , so \"when in Rome\" (er' France...) I'll do as the Romans (French) do, and eat them in a creamy buttery sauce. I still enjoyed them, just not my top preference. The mussels came were accompanied by fresh fried \"frites\" (fries) that were excellent, as my fiance was soaking up all the residual cream sauce with the french bread and fries.\n\nWe then ordered steaks as our entree.  I ordered a simple sirloin steak with some minor requests and they were all met to my expectations.  My fiance had the porterhouse, charred on the outside and medium on the in.  All came with \"frites\" and the taste, portions and price were all excellent and totally fair.  Couldn't be happier and can't even wait to return! We definitely recommend it!"

Basically because I love to go to different restaurants. Fran and I have been to several different places along Las Vegas Boulevard. Today the weather was perfect with a good strong breeze. I suggested we try someplace with patio dining. Fran, who was driving decided we were going to Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nIn all the places we have eaten, ZACH was easily the most professional of servers we have ever encountered. I honestly hope he sees this review, he does deserve the praise.\n\nOkay, on to the meals...\n\nFran ordered the Prime Steak sandwich with caramelized onions and peppercorn mayo. \nShe enjoyed every last bite. The first time we went to Mon Abi Gabi, I ordered the Steak sandwich and immediately took note of the long cut made through the sandwich. I the meal was \"just what the doctor ordered.\" I am kinda surprised I didn't order it a second time. But since Fran ordered it I decided to try something different.\n\nI ordered the Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi sandwich. Served with sriracha mayo and pickled vegetables, and cilantro. There was a little more mayo then I like, but it was easily overlooked after a bite or two, It's a sandwich you will have to lick your fingers while devouring.\n\nWe both had hand cut frites with out meal. So far only a few places on Las Vegas Boulevard would I say were better than these. (Feel free to ask for the other places)\n\nIn closing I would just like to say...\n\nI work in a casino and when people ask my advice for a good place to go eat. Mon Ami Gabi is usually one of the first places I would suggest. \n\nGreat place to feel that \"Las Vegas experience\".\n\nGreat view for the Bellagio Fontains, people watching, or maybe even that significant other sitting on the other side of the table from you.\n\nGreat selections on the menu. Decent prices that won't empty your wallet or purses.\n\nI would suggest, when taking a trip to Las Vegas, put Mon Ami Gabi on you bucket list for places to go eat. Read less"

If my company wasn't paying for it, I probably wouldn't get dinner here.  \n\nOrdered:\n\nOnion Soup Au Gratin - 6/10.  It was a good onion soup to be sure, but for $11... I dunno about that.\n\nFilet Mignon w Merlot Wine Reduction - 7/10.  This was a beautifully cooked steak.  Maybe I'm just over $40 steaks at restaurants when I feel like I can make a better one using my sous vide at home.  There are still some steakhouses that outdo me and my sous vide, but this place wasn't one of them. The merlot reduction was tasty though.\n\nThe free table side bread is a solid 7/10.  \n\nView - 8/10.  \n\nSo that places this kind of in the 3.5star range. I do have to note, you want to sit outside.  The view of the Bellagio fountains from these seats is amazing.  It's honestly a better view than from the Bellagio restaurants themselves (thinking Olives, Picasso, etc), since you get to watch the show head on instead of from a side angle."

I ordered it medium rare but it was definitely medium well/well done.  I chose brie for the cheese in my burger and the portion for that was tiny - didn't even fill up the surface area of the burger and it was unevenly distributed.  There was a super thick piece on side side and a tiny on the other.  The lettuce on the burger was half of a piece of romaine, with a huge stem.  I hate having stems in the lettuce on a burger.  The bun could have been warmer too.  The frites were soggy, which was very disappointing.  Although it was all edible, the food did not live up to my expectations.  The actual restaurant itself is very nice and cute.  So much potential to be a 5 Yelp star place!\n\nThe service was pretty bad too.

I remembered it being very flavorful, the crepe filled with whole large shrimps, scallops, mushrooms & peas. This time around the crepe was folded thinly with ONLY peas and sauce. And sadly, sitting on top of the crepe were 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 medium scallops. The sauce and crepe itself tasted very bland! My friend ordered the lobster roll. She was very pleased with it. She said it was delicious and filled with lobster chunks. On a positive note, the baguette was delicious and our server was nice. I will still dine here, but I won't order the seafood crepe again."

  "text" : "(3.5)\n\nWe went here for my mom's 70th birthday dinner and there was 20 of us.  I was disappointed we could not reserve to sit outside so I did not get the best part of this place.  Instead we were seated inside which was rather dark and loud especially for older people.  Also, they would not seat us until half our party was there which was kind of annoying.  I did not like the seating arrangement that much because I was sitting in a place where I could not get out unless everyone in my row scooted over and let me.  \n\nOur waitress was attentive except she gave the cupcake to wrong person not my mom, which I am sure was an honest mistake.  Over all I would say the service was good here. \n\nEveryone seemed to like their food.  I got the scallops which were decent although the side that came with it was not too impressive.  I believe you can switch that out though. Pretty reasonable prices for Vegas I would say.  I think next time I would want to sit on the patio.  I went and looked at it and it was way nicer.  I would go back and try this place again and maybe order the salmon.  My mom said that was yummy."

  "text" : "I absolutely loved the view at Mon Ami Gabi. We were fortunate enough to get a seat outside and the vegan protest in the view we encountered, only added to the experience. I did not give this 4 stars due to the service. I don't know if our waiter was avoiding our table purposely, but I did feel like we had to flag him down a few times in order to get service. If the case was that he was overwhelmed, then that is an issue the restaurant needs to address. We had a group of 5, so gratuity was already added to our check, so maybe he did not feel the need to work for it and be a bit more attentive to the table. He also seemed to be a bit rushed when he was taking our order. Not to mention, the \"secret service\" (probably the floor manager) standing by our table throughout the duration of our meal. It was just a bit cramp to have him hoovering the entire time. \n\nThe meal was ok. I had the Beef Wellington, but was not pleased with it. The best part of eating in a group is being able to sample a variety of dishes at one time. Our appetizer: Warm Triple Cheese was delicious beyond words. My sister had the Salmon which was also tasty. My friend had the Hanger Steak...arguably the best thing at the table. We had Chocolate Mousse and Caramel Crème Brulee for dessert. The Brulee was the better of the two."

It's also open for breakfast, lunch & dinner and dinner time is my favorite for sitting outside and taking in people watching along with the beautiful Bellagio fountains. People watching in Vegas never gets old! \n\nThe food is excellent and I need to try breakfast here as that's the only thing I haven't done yet. For lunch I love the quiche, lemon salmon dish or the ham & cheese tartine. And for dinner I've had the salmon as well that usually comes with some type of purée like peas or potato and the steaks with frites here are excellent! You pick whether you would like the classic with some herb butter or get a little fancy with it and have caramelized onions and red wine sauce! This one is sweet and we loved it last night! The seafood platters are excellent here along with the fantastic cheese plates. I haven't had anything I didn't like...\n\nNow the best part about this place is the ambiance! And of course the company...\n\nI bring my favorite people here and last night was extra special as it was my moms first time. Every time we've attempted to come here in the past its either raining or full. \n\nThis time was perfect. We sat outside. The temperature was amazing in the high 70's and we just enjoyed ourselves. Bring someone special here and whether it's a friend, lover or family member they will most likely enjoy it. \n\nParis holds a very special place in my heart and this is as close as it gets in Vegas..."

The waitress brought us more when we asked! Hooray! The ones brought later were warmer. I couldn't stop filling up on the delicious carbs. \n\nI got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had green apples, caramelized onions and an aioli. The bottom of the sandwich got soggy really quickly. It was alright. It came with some french fries which I didn't even try to finish. They were okay. \n\nMy friend ordered a banana muffin. After one taste, I knew that I had to order one to go. The banana muffin ($3.99) was really good. It was a big muffin, but sort of flat on top. Don't expect very much muffin top, if that's what you're in to. The muffin was moist and the edges were nice and crispy. It did not have any nuts, which is a bummer. There were big chunks of banana in the batter. I would come back just to order the muffin to go."

  "text" : "The Skinny: better for dinner than lunch or brunch (3), service: solid but nothing special (3), value: overpriced given the location but not a terrible spot for dinner and a view of the Bellagio fountains (3).\n\nThe hubs and I come here every once in a while as a part of the Lettuce Entertain You club member. Every year, they send birthday gift certificates and discounts off meals at their restaurants in town (El Segundo, Strip burger, Joe's Stone Crab, Mon Ami Gabi, Eiffel Tower restaurant) during the summer months.\n\nWe've used the coupon for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Of the three meals, I give the edge to dinner in terms of value. First things first though - use Opentable to make reservations. Given the location and moderate Strip price point (although kind of pricey still), Mon Ami Gabi can be hopping depending on which day you decide to come.\n\nAs always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. They also serve a small amount of vegetable salad during dinner - once it was an apple/radish dish, another it was a carrot salad.\n\nI must admit, I am kind of boring when I come here to eat and rarely deviate from my routine. I am not usually this bad but this is because in terms of portion size (they tend to be skimpy on serving sizes here)/price point and yum factor, this dish is probably your best bet. I usually get the Chicken Grand-Mere which is a half roasted cornish hen, sauteed mushrooms and lardons, with mashed potatoes for $23.95. The chicken skin a perfectly crispy while the meat is tender and moist. The mushrooms with lardons are a nice combination which goes well with the buttery mashed potatoes. Standard fare but executed well.\n\nThe hubs will either usually get the skate wing or the special of the day which rotates based on the day of the week. The skate wing is truly delicious for $25.95 - if you haven't had it, you should try it.\n\nOur last venture, he had the Friday special which is dover sole lightly pan fried in butter with slightly wilted spinach and roasted potatoes. The dover sole was very good albeit areas were a bit over salted. The spinach was okay. The roasted potatoes were delicious and sported a nice crispy exterior.\n\nWe also came on a Sunday where he ordered the beef wellington special. The beef wellington was okay in my books - the puff pastry didn't really hold up to the moisture of the meat and mushroom duxelle. As well, the meat was a bit overdone from what he had ordered (medium rare was made to medium... this is the tough part about ordering beef wellington).\n\nTo be honest, we normally do not go for the steak frites mostly because I am not a fan of their frites (more of a potato chip texture than fries per se) and from the looks of other table's dishes, the portion sizes of the steak are small.\n\nOverall, if you are coming for a view of the Bellagio fountains, this is an inexpensive way to have dinner with a view at reasonable prices for the Strip. The food is okay and portion sizes are a bit smaller than what you'd expect for the price. Dinner is definitely more reasonable than lunch or breakfast in terms of value and execution."

  "text" : "We've started coming here for the last 3 years based on a friend's recommendations.  The first couple visits the filet mignon with Merlot butter sauce was to die for.  Every visit after the steak has come out with a large pat of cold Merlot butter on top that we've had to send back.  Either that is how it was always supposed to be or there is a new cook in the kitchen but for what I'm paying and to keep coming back here, I expect the sauce to be properly melted, not a cold stick of butter.  The waiter also couldn't have cared less when we pointed out and had to be told we wanted this fixed.  If you don't know how this dish should be prepared it's not a problem, if you've had it as it should be prepared, it is.  \n\nThat being said, we'll probably still come here just because out of towners want to come when visiting, but we will not be making reservations anymore on our own."

What other casinos try to emulate, Gabi delivers--a next-best-thing Parisian experience, rather than eating expensive shitty pasta at the Palaccio or god knows what at New York, New York.\n\nMy friends and I were moderately dressed up (no ties, or heels) and did not feel out of place or unwelcome for a moment.  The lighting is very flattering and cozy-feeling, and our server (who was the human embodiment of espresso, or perhaps cocaine) made us feel very welcome and comfortable.\n\nMeal starts with free baguettes which don't stun, but hey, there's a gorgeous and well-curated wine cart.  Cut whatever carb-related losses you have and order the French onion soup (divine, and made with cognac).  I had the mussels and the fries which were both truly scrumptious.  Other friends orders the scallops (four out of five), wild boar pasta (five out of five), and a sirloin (six out of five) that even my pescetarian self had to have a bite out of.  They know their way around a cut of beef here, selecting prime cow only, a bone-in cut, with a perfect outside char/sear and blood red middle.  It. Was. Amaze.\n\nDon't sit on the patio or you're missing the ambiance.  Do hit up that wine cart more than once.  While we did order the bananas foster crepe, I'm not sure I would order it again.

We were here for dinner. \n\nThe waitress was very nice. She was pleasant and always available for all of our needs. She also helped us understand the menu. Now the menu is in french because we are in Paris! If you go to Paris, with the real eiffel tower, you will find menu in more than one languages! The atmosphere is very dark, low light and crammed places for us to sit. \n\nThe appetizers were very good. I would strongly recommend those to anyone who is here for just a bite and some booze. I am not sure I can say that for anything else on the menu. Now for a good restaurant, it is very hard to screw up the appetizers. But the main dishes even though their menu has not changed much over the years are not excellent taste. The location definitely invites a lot of people because they can get the free view of the Belaggio fountains. \n\nAvoid if you are looking for an intimate place to seat and eat very good food.

I went this past Sunday for a friend's birthday gathering. She wanted to sit outside but it was a couple hour wait for a table so she went with one inside. They won't seat you until everyone in your party is there. Even though this place is very big there were still a few people waiting outside for their table & inside was full. Our waitress (don't know her name) was very good & attentive. They serve a warm bread loaf in a bag that is actually really good only problem is it's very messy so you get crumbs all over the table & there is no one coming by wiping up your crumbs like some restaurants have. I got a grilled ham & cheese with a cheese like sauce that I got on the side. Sauce was tasty & the sandwich was OK. One side wasn't grilled & the other side that was, was dried. The french fries were good. Others got the Eggs Benedict that they all liked & one girl got the quiche which she said was good. Our waters were always full. It's worth checking out especially if you can get outdoor seating thats right on the strip, great place to people watch!"

The food here was pretty good. The wine was nice but overpriced for the bottle and the soup was amazing! My entire (don't remember what I got but I posted a photo) was alright, the sauce wasn't all that, and to be honest this place is overpriced. I know it's a French establishment in Vegas and that's to be expected, but for a bottle of wine, soup, and an entree split amongst 3 girls, we ended up paying $80 and I think I could have gotten better tasting food for less. The soup is good though, I'd come again for that. The carrot thing that comes with your bread is kind of odd, and it got annoying when the waiter kept hovering around us, and the waiter for the table next to us was very loud and wouldn't shut up. Make sure to get good seats outside and not inside where everyone will bother you."

I know I can't add much to what has already been said but my son and I found this restaurant so good we ate here three times in a short two day stay in Vegas- it was in our hotel, the Paris, and it was great every time we ate here.  Service was always excellent,  our most exceptional server was Tracy at breakfast.   I doubt that you would find service as good or friendly in a real French restaurant in Paris. \n\nFrench restaurants I've found have always been a little too much on the pretentious side for my taste but this one really serves some exceptional fare with a distinct French twist.  The Croque Madame for breakfast was really good.  The fries were always exceptional, for breakfast and with steaks at night.  The French Onion soup was really well done.   The scallop appetizer done au gratin was one of the best scallop dishes I've ever tasted.   The restaurant has a warm and very comfortable bistro feel to it and I would recommend it highly.\n\nThe patio outside has a million dollar view of the Bellagio water show across the street so there is usually a wait for tables outside.  We never experienced any major delay in seating for an inside table."

The escargot was perfect and the bagette was ideal for dunking in the buttery sauce afterwards. The mussels were amazing, some of the best I've had.

  "text" : "This place is not \"Great\" but it does have such a solid balance between ambiance and quality and price and location that it gets these 4 stars from me and as you see 5 stars from many others.\n\nThey have a beautiful 24oz bone ribeye well under $40. Where else can you get that while dining al fresco on the strip, across from the Bellagio fountains with such good service? Answer: nowhere. It's not aged of course but it is a quality piece of cow nonetheless. Some items fall a little short like their escargot. Not terrible but a bit on the bland side. The frites are just right. Nice side demi glaze. Good bread basket and great butter. Proper adult beverages. My point is that whatever you order here (I've been here  few times over the years), at worst, you'll get a better than average experience. If you're lucky you'll get one of their better items and really get double your money's worth. All this while getting treated well and sitting classy yet comfortable surroundings.\n\nTry it at least once. \n\nPS\nSomeone's review calls this restaurant \"overpriced.\" Respectfully, that's just silly. I'd be happy to have that person point out a better priced, above average and so well located restaurant on the strip. Go across the street to Bellagio and into Prime. You'll be dropping nearly three figures on a mid-priced cut there."

  "text" : "Mon Ami Gabi deserves its 4-star rating. We dined here for breakfast, and it did not disappoint. The food was delicious with an unbeatable view of the strip to boot. \n\nTips: \n1. You can make a reservation here, but that will preclude you from eating on the patio. Reservations are strictly for inside the restaurant. \n\n2. The wait for the patio is worth it. When we arrived at around 8:30 am, the hostess notified us that the wait would be 20-30 minutes. In reality, our buzzer rang after just 10 minutes. \n\n3. The most popular breakfast items are the Benedicts and the Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs. For sweeter entrees, our server recommended the Skinny Pancakes (crepes) and French Toast (made with brioche baked in-house). \n\nWe ordered the Salmon Benedict and the Corned Beef, both of which we loved! The Salmon Benedict was a unique twist on the traditional dish. The English muffin cradling the salmon and poached egg was unbelievably fresh and delicious. It blows Thomas English muffins out of the water. The Corned Beef dish was equally phenomenal. This meat is not your canned corned beef. It's actual pieces of tender, salt-cured steak, accompanied by soft pieces of potato. The poached eggs were the perfect topper. Once you break open the eggs, the yolk oozes all over the meat and potatoes, adding even more flavor to the dish. Both the Salmon Benedict and the Corned Beef were served with a side of hash browns, which were good but not noteworthy. \n\nWe are glad we came for breakfast and hope to return for dinner the next time we are in town."

  "text" : "Attended a business dinner here with a group of 12, although the line was out the door and the restaurant was filled to near capacity we were seated immediately upon arriving in one of the side rooms to the left of the hostess station. Our server met us with a warm smile and went over a few of the night's specials. It was apparently that the staff was really being stretched as the simple menus were being distributed and the water glasses filled, our server very politely informed us she'd return shortly to get our drink orders. \n\nAfter about 10 minute as promised she returned and took our drink orders although we were wanting to order a selection of appetizers for the table to share she dashed off to enter our drink orders. Having been seated for a least 20 minutes our drinks arrived and she began taking the appetizer orders avoiding mentioning anything else referencing to placing our dinner orders although we had possession of the menus for at least 30 minutes and the first rounds of drinks were mostly expired. Now we all understood this was a informal business dinner and time wasn't really a concern except for a few that had rather be spending their time at the craps table or feeding the one arm bandits. The appetizers arrived and a second round of refreshments were ordered, after clearing the table of the seafood food selections and distribution of the recently order round of cocktails to the dismay of a few inpatient souls who seemed unimpressed with the evening  and felt the evening was slipping away we finally placed our entree orders. \n\nI will say the oysters were exceptional not only were they fresh and cleanly shucked with the shells still full of the natural liquor, they were sized nicely and delicious as well as plentiful. \n\nAfter more than a hour a half the entrees began arriving after and after being somewhat surprised at how inexpensive the dinner selections were I wasn't that surprised on the quality and in fact was a little disappointed to find such a popular venue didn't have a more upscale selection. I should of known during the orientation upon arriving I remembered it was stated that \"the sirloin\" was pointed out as their signature dish huh, along with their signature fries which I chose to pass on. I chose the filet with asparagus and a kale salad adorned with a soft poached egg, honestly the salad was amazing with its generous portion of shredded kale and fresh cooked bacon with a warm bacon dressing. The filet ordered medium rare came out well done and the asparagus was cold and tough. \n\nAlthough the venue was very nice with good service for the amount of customers being crammed in, the food was just okay considering the dinner went on for more than two and a half hours with time for only two cocktails to be served. Several of us chose to exit once the desserts were explained and our gracious host offered this as an option since it was getting rather late in the evening. With all the exceptional dinner choices available on the strip I would consider this restaurant again for breakfast or lunch or even for an afternoon drink with oysters appetizers but not for dinner."

So PERFECT in every way!  So juicy, soft, flavorful, and cooked perfectly!!! I'm a huge A1 sauce fan (as in I can't eat steak without it) but this steak was so amazing that I wouldn't even think of adding anything to it. So tender it practically melts in your mouth. All of the other girls were also extremely happy with their dishes... FOODIES PARADISE!\n\nNot only was the food 5 stars, the service was equally amazing. We almost cancelled our reservations since we were running 45 minutes late and had to be somewhere by 8pm. Even though we didn't get to the restaurant until after 7pm, our waitress kindly accommodated our tight schedule and got us taken care of and out by 750pm. \n\nIf you are planning any bachelorette party or events, this place is a must!

When we asked our server if he had a recipe for us or any recommendations on what to put in the Bloody Mary, he was extremely sassy and unhelpful.

It's Vegas so it does get warm, but I like outside because you get to people watch and if you're lucky, catch the Bellagio fountain show. The tables have umbrellas to shield you from most of the sun. When we were there two men were playing instruments on the street, so that was cool. \n\nI had the mushroom and Brie omelette. It comes with toast and hash browns. Mmm the hash browns have caramelized onions cooked into it so they are sweet and perfectly crispy. The omelette was perfectly cooked - not burnt and good ratio of toppings and cheese. The toast is baguette which can be a little rough on your mouth, but worth it. They serve a berry preserve on the side. \n\nMy boyfriend had the corned beef hash. I thought because it had potatoes in it that it wouldn't come with hash browns, but it did! My boyfriend loved and it. My mom tried it and liked it so much she said she'd order that next time. The meat is shredded and very tender. \n\nMy mom had the giant pancake with berries. Yum! Basically a huge crepe with buttery lemony goodness and berries and powdered sugar. Oh and there's fresh whip cream on the side that is great. \n\nMy mom's boyfriend had the special of the day - a mushroom Benedict on baguette. So good! Their hollandaise was right on and eggs were cooked perfectly. \n\nBy the end of our meal, around 11:15, the sun was moving and the majority of our table was getting hit by the sun. We were out of there just in time! But if you go for lunch time there are misters to keep you cool."

Not part of total rewards though as I recall.   As always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. We then always start with the Three cream cheese w/ roasted garlic and mushrooms. I love it. The salmon salad is delicious and the steak is the bomb!! Try finishing with the lemon creme brulee! Exellent place to people watch, prices decent, and the fountains at night are beautiful."

The Steak Frites were delicious and the kids meals are fun and big portioned.  We mainly chose this because our children love the bellagio fountains.  We sat out on the patio on a perfect 80 degree evening in April.  Only disappointment was about halfway through our dinner a large bus parked right out front and blocked our view.  Absolutely absurd!!!!  Definitely killed the ambiance.  I feel bad for the restaurant and its patrons that this no doubt occurs on a regular basis.  We still loved the place though!

Reservations get you an inside table in this enormous restaurant. For patio seating, its first come basis.  Restrooms are accessible to the casino sportsbook outside the casino, underneath Eiffel Tower.\n\nFor food its a solid 4 stars for me.  Mussels were excellent - plump, juicy, and just 2-3 un-opened.  Their wine-butter-garlic sauce was unbelievably good.  Bread dipped here is far better than fries.  Fries were crispy but a bit oily and too skinny for me - I can barely taste any potato.\n\nTheir Bloody Mary cocktail is definitely on the spicy side, and it had two good-sized olives for some additional tartness. I got the version with Grey Goose vodka.\n\nWe also tried their salmon salad - a wonderful combination of spinach, kale, blueberries, walnuts, and a nice citrus dressing.  Salmon was perfectly cooked and there was lots of it!\n\nI ordered the pulled pork banh mi - it had a ciabatta bun I think and good spiciness from Sriracha and acidity from pickled veggies.  It did come with those oily, skinny fries however.\n\nFor desserts, the profiteroles comes three per order and was a nice ice cream sandwich held together by cream puff pastry.  It was drenched in fudge and was just so decadent.  Highly recommended."

All at reasonable prices (for Vegas). The cocktails were pricey (around $15), but a good classic steak frites for $28 seems like a good price to me. \n\nStarted with warm baguette at the table. Our party ordered the steak frites. They serve it several different ways. I got the classique, which I loved. It comes served with an herb butter on top. Others in my party got different sauces. Everyone was happy. Steak was well cooked for each order (we had mix of medium rare through medium well). \n\nIf you want to splurge, in terms of price, try the French 75 cocktail. If you want to splurge, in terms of calories, try the bananas foster. The chocolate mousse was good, especially the chocolate pearls, but it wasn't as amazing as I had hoped it would be."

  "text" : "My family and I have lived here since 1989. I absolutely love going to Mon Ami Gabi. Every time we go there we always request to get seated outside to get a great view of the Bellagio fountains. During the Spring and Fall is the perfect time to sit outside. I would only sit out there at night if you are here in the summer. I highly recommend you make reservations as well through OpenTable or calling to request this seating in advance. \n\nThe bread is buttery with a smooth butter spread. The last time we went my boyfriend ordered the housemade country Pate and I had the baked goat cheese. I personally enjoyed the baked goat cheese more because of the rich tomato sauce. The pate was also delicious especially on that warm toast. \n\nWe shared the French onion soup, which was tasty. It was not too salty and the cheese was melted well over the bread. Probably one of the best French onion soups I have had in Vegas. \n\nFor the main course, I had the Steak Frites Au Poivre and my boyfriend had the Filet Mignon Merlot. If you enjoy a creamy peppercorn sauce then get the Au Poivre. I recommend the Filet Mignon as a must for first-timers. The steak was so soft and juicy. The merlot sauce pushed the experience to the next level. My taste buds were ecstatic to enjoy something so decadent. The filet mignon here is the best for those who do enjoy tender meat. We both got ours medium. \n\nOur sides were the frites (fries) and the brussel sprouts. Enjoyed them both as well! However, we did see the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms pass by our table, which also looked delicious so I would recommend trying those if you want lighter sides. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the creme brulee. It was a decent size. The top was crisp and the custard was excellent. I highly recommend this dish as well. The ambiance was perfect for a beautiful date night, birthday celebration, or anytime you are feeling fancy for great steak. Service was excellent! I love how authentic it was to have someone from France wait on us. It really brought the experience together."

The bar was super fun and had anything you could want in a bloody mary short of the kitchen sink. The salad had bacon and egg on it so it was the perfect brunch dish - breakfast and lunch on a plate.

  "text" : "Steak frites, s'il vous plaît !\n\nMon Ami Gabi is an awesome little restaurant located in the Paris Hotel and Casino that serves up delectable French dishes and plentiful plates of steak and fries that won't break your wallet.\n\nOur group decided to come here on a weeknight for dinner and were met with two options; there was little to no wait to be seated on the inside of the restaurant, but if we decided to sit on the outside terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, we would need to wait 40 minutes or more. We decided to stick it out and wait for a seat outside. Time goes by quick when the gaming tables are just a few steps away!\n\nWe split the Frisee, Kale and Warm Bacon Salad as an appetizer. This was delicious! Even for salad haters, you can't go wrong with bacon and a soft egg. The runny yolk over everything added a nice richness to the crisp greens, and the savory bacon added a nice crunch. \n\nFor my main, I went with the Filet Mignon Au Poivre. It's a little pricier than the other steaks on the menu, but if you're a meat lover like me, then I think it's totally worth the extra $10! The thick cut of steak steak was cooked to medium perfection, as I requested, and the brandy peppercorn sauce was divine! The meat was perfect; juicy, and amazingly tender. Fries were pretty meh - I'm not the biggest fan of fries in the world, and plus I prefer the thick cut style to thin and crispy. To compensate, we ordered sides to share. We ended up getting the sautéed mushrooms and an order of garlic spinach. The mushrooms were standard steakhouse fare, but the garlic spinach was delicious! Super garlicky. Plus I felt a little better having some green on my plate. Kinda healthy.\n\nThe view of the Bellagio fountains cannot be beat, especially during dinner. It's a great spot for people watching and I have to say that I think it's a little better suited for groups than for a romantic dinner. The tables are bunched up pretty close together, so much so that you can pretty much eavesdrop on your neighbors conversations! The servers here are very welcoming and friendly, but not the most attentive. We asked for ketchup twice and didn't get any until towards the end of the meal. I'd cut them some slack though, even on a weeknight the outside patio looked totally slammed!\n\nIn terms of value, this place cannot be beat! The steak is delicious, and after splitting the appetizers, my tab for dinner came out to be what I would pay for an ala carte steak anywhere else on the strip. Cheap, yes. But not cheap tasting! If you're craving steak in Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is not to be missed!"

  "text" : "when i flew in on monday night, I fear that I may miss my reservation getting here via the shuttle bus, but I did manage to get there on time.  now for starters, everyone keeps mentioning to go out and eat outside and enjoy the view of bellagio's water show.  No i wouldn't recommend it.  It was freezing cold and literally everyone who was sitting outside scrambled to find the last remaining seats inside.  Luckily the evening wasn't so packed, and managed to find an open seating inside that is rich with rustic feel. My opinion is to stick around inside the room away from the bar.\n\nTo start off with, I had the pumpkin soup that had a light cream base and crusted almonds.  Unfortunately with all the craze the hostess and waiters and waitresses were scrambling to find seats for people, the soup came after my main course which was a little harder to finish, but I insisted on tasting and finding what made this the place to eat! The soup was by far delicious and flavorful and it immediately warmed you up after this craze weather!\n\nOnto the main course, I had the Filet Mignon Merlot with a glass of merlot. when it came out, the meat was shimmering glazed and a stack of frites. I ordered a side of brussel sprouts on the side to balance the sweetness of the Filet Mignon. By making that first cut into the filet, you can feel the tenderness of the cut fall slowly to the plate glistened in the glaze.  Taking that first bite of the filet mignon was just explosion happening and enjoying the moment! Food was just amazing!\n\nOverall the meal was by far amazing minus the crazy hiccup of the weather, but the staff and team managed to get everyone in and everyone enjoyed the night.  This is definitely worth going again."

They know you won't spend tons of money, so they don't give you as much attention."

  "text" : "Das Mon Ami Gabi ist definitiv einen Besuch wert, wenn man in Vegas auf der Suche nach unfrittiertem Essen oder gehobener Küche ist. Die Wartezeit betrug für uns (wir waren zu zweit) 15 Minuten, die wir, mit einem Piepser ausgestattet, im Casino verbringen konnten. Somit kann man die Zeit zumindest \"sinnvoll\" nutzen und seinen Kontostand aufpolieren ;) der Vollständigkeit halber sei erwähnt, dass diese Wartezeit nur für die Terrasse galt, im Innenbereichen des Restaurants hätten wir umgehend einen Tisch erhalten.\n\nDas Ambiente im Restaurant selbst empfanden wir als recht drückend (schummriges Licht, dunkles Mobiliar), auf der Terrasse hingegen hat man perfekte Sicht auf die Wasserspiele des Bellagio gegenüber.\n\nDer Service war sehr angenehm und zuvorkommend. Als Appetizer gab es ofenfrisches Baguette, Butter und einen kleinen \"Gruß aus der Küche\". \nDie Hauptgerichte, welche wir aus dem vielfältigen Angebot wählten, (Ragout vom Wildschwein auf selbstgemachten Nudeln sowie Hühnchenpaillard auf einem Basilikum-Rucola-Püree) waren ausgezeichnet und geschmacklich sehr ausgewogen. Eine erfrischende Abwechslung zu Burger und Pommes.\n\nHinsichtlich des Preises für eine Abend im Mon Ami Gabi kann man sagen: Ja, die Preise sind höher, wenn man sie mit den meisten Fast-Food-Restaurants am Strip vergleicht, allerdings bekommt man dafür gehobene Kost von hervorragender Qualität, rundum guten Service und einen wunderbaren Ausblick auf der Terrasse."

The warm baguettes they bring out with butter are awesome, the sangria is delicious, the fries were really outstanding and the steak even though we had to switch plates because one was ordered medium and the other medium well, the service was still great.  The pumpkin soup was yummy with the nuts on it and the steaks with béarnaise sauce and mushrooms was delicious.  Great location, good service and good food.  Will definitely come back on another visit."

Located in the shadow of Paris and directly across the street from the Bellagio and its fountains, you get a great view of the busy Las Vegas and the Fountains when it dances to music.\n\nIt has been a couple of years since we were here, but I still remember vividly the delicious tomato salad with salmon I got. The salmon was cooked perfectly so it's still moist and the tomatoes were of a variety of colors and seasoned just right. In addition, we had escargots, baked brie and a couple of entrees.\n\nAll the dishes we ordered were good, the service is good and the view, that view is magnificent. You can't go wrong eating here."

Being a tourist: this was the best location to be at. You can see al the craziness and appreciate the Bellagio fountains. Molly, our server was extremely pleasant and professional. We ordered a carafe of their sangria. Which was yummy, a bit too sweet but the ice took care of that. We had the escargot. It wasn't in the sell, so that was different.... it was a bit too garlicky for my liking and the flavor wasn't very full. I would not order it there again. We also ordered their onion soup which was great!  Especially with the fresh bread they serve. OH! I almost forgot, their butter was amazing! There was a bit of a wait but with a place that packed you cant really take that into consideration. My friend ordered the merlot filet mignon.. Divine! The fries were a bit greasy and since they were thinly sliced the grease was a bit more concentrated,  but were still delicious! I had the mussels. Holy moly! Their garlic sauce was amazing! I would have taken Molly up on the offer for more bread had I not been so full! Only 2 mussels weren't opened, The steak was cooked just right. They had a special salad, but my fat cousin decided to join us. He ate it, lol.The salad had great presentation. Some sort of fish, maybe bass? Not quite sure. We also asked the server if it was okay for him to join us in the middle of us eating, she didn't mind. We requested a dessert and a drink to be placed in front of him as soon as he sat down. HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY. I FREAKING LOVED THIS PLACE!  Next time in in town I will DEFINITELY visit again."

We made a reservation for 2:15 PM, and due to traffic and backed up valet getting into Paris Hotel, we were running late. The resturant was very understanding and did seat us right away. While I would've preferred an outdoor seating area, it would've been a 35-45 minute wait. The Resturant did seat us window side so we could still see the beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains. I enjoyed our enthusiastic server, and food was delicious. I usually don't finish my food, but instead I licked the plate clean! My boyfriend had the ham and cheese crepe while I had the Skate Wing and French Onion soup. Everything was so flavorful and combination of food and ingredients went great together. My birthday ice cream cream puff was decadent! I should've saved room for the Chocolate/ Candy store, Hexx next door, but our meal was worth it!

I have ZERO problem with \"gay\" people and have lots of friends that are. But please, have some professionalism I don't enjoy being called \"sweetie\" nor do I enjoy the embracing antics and the flamboyance I'd see at a drag show. Please I respect you as a person but you (a man) don't need to be putting lipgloss on as you take my order. Making my guests who are men uncomfortable. Im a woman and I don't think that's appropriate for me to do in that situation either. This person thought that it had something to do with his lifestyle instead of me just finding him personally annoying. I asked the very kind manager to switch my table and even after she did he continued his verbal assault on me. \n\nAfter this I really just question the management at Mon Ami for letting him stay there. I say that because as the owner of company with 70+ employees this was by far unwarranted. I've never lost anyone in 3 years to any drama. I just wanted to take my friends to a beautiful QUIET brunch and did not appreciate the SHOW he was putting on. I'll be calling to see if he's working before I return next time because I'm not going let one bad egg ruin my favorite brunch spot."

  "text" : "The food was good, but service was pretty checked out and uninterested in doing their jobs. \n\n(1) Our waitress pushed alcohol on a member of the group ... even though this person had clearly expressed a desire to have something \"non-alcoholic\" the waitress asked two more times whether he would prefer a beer or some wine. Get the hint! Sometimes people don't drink and don't want to be pressured into drinking! \n\n(2) Our waitress dropped dessert silverware in front of us from a height of maybe three inches... it felt kind of like she just threw the silverware down. She was looking away when she did this ... the message was \"I could care less.\" \n\n(3) When a member of the dinner party accidentally dropped his butter knife, five staff were standing nearby and heard the clang of the knife on the stone floor. They looked up, but then went back to their chatting at the wait station ... at a good restaurant, someone would quickly bring a new knife to the person who had dropped theirs. We had to flag someone down and specifically ask for a knife. \n\n(4) The waitress picked up our credit slip after we'd signed it and checked the tip while standing at our table. Good wait staff leave the credit slip on the table and do not touch it until the diners have departed.\n\nThere were a couple of good people on the team. We did get good service from one individual in particular, and I wish I could remember his name. But the overall experience was not great."

We were able to watch the bellagio water show at 30 minute intervals while we dined. \nSo lets start with service\n5/5 Susu was our server, she was so awesome and definitely had so much charisma, hospitality and was so well-versed with the menu\nI got Chardonnay, mushroom soup and the scallops.\nHusband got the steak frites\nBrother in Law got the Salmon salad\ni HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the scallops. Ok, I find it very hard to find a place with PERFECTLY seared scallops. They were seared in brown butter, and were accompanied by a mushroom sauce, and they were the most perfectly cooked scallops i have ever had. Not rubbery or chewy, and just tender enough on the inside. SUPERB\nReally enjoyed everything about this place.\nThe baguette that came in the beginning was a little hard for me... other than that everything was so delicious.\nSo happy with my entire experience.\nAlso, their coffee is great. Asked how they brew it and they use Intelligentsia coffee beans, and they grind them daily and brew them fresh everyday so no wonder it was incredible"

  "text" : "I'll admit it, I was skeptical of spending Thanksgiving at a French restaurant but WOW. When we got there the place was PACKED - there was a line streaming out into the casino. We had reservations but still had to wait just a bit but there's a nice little bar out on the patio where you can see the Bellagio fountains going off across the street. Despite being so busy, the staff was very nice and helpful through the madness. \n\nEveryone in our party of four opted for the $49.99 prix fixe which was the perfect Thanksgiving meal away from home. For the first, second and desert courses there were two options. For the first course I went with oysters on the half shell which were perfectly shucked and served with a mignonette sauce as well as a cocktail sauce. The other option was a dressed up version of salmon and lox on a baguette type bread. For the second course it was a choice between a salad or a butternut squash soup and let me tell you, the soup was AMAZING. Best soup ever. As I was contemplating licking my bowl for every last drop of goodness, they brought out the main entrees. In true Thanksgiving style, each person received a plate that would probably better be described as a platter, loaded with all the traditional fixings - even a small selection of both light and dark turkey meat. Two different types of potatoes, cranberry sauce, and delicious stuffing. I am typically a proud member of the clean plate club but I couldn't even come close to finishing it all. Dessert was a choice between a pecan tart and pumpkin creme brulee. Obviously we had to go with the creme brulee and it was perfection. \n\nIt was a wonderful meal with great service and I would highly recommend it for a holiday, special occassion, or just when you are looking for something a step above. I would love to go back sometime and try some French food!"

  "text" : "Let me say this first, it may have been the absolute best Beef Bourguignon I have ever had. The service was pretty good with only a few sides delivered to the wrong peeps. The management was adequate. The view of the fountains was only better if standing across the street in front of the Bellagio, which is really the only place to see them without the palm trees in the way. \n\nMy issues are about the hard core screwing we took for us to have our dinner for 13 there. They wanted a $100 non refundable deposit (only charged to larger parties) an 18% gratuity, and I was still ok with that as long as the service successfully stood up to the challenge (and for the most part it did). But then came the kicker...another 4% plus taxes on the 4% just because we were...a wedding dinner. They called it a banquet charge but I call bullshit on that. If we were two tables next to each other with 6 and 7 respectively it would have been business as usual in that the tables are barely 12 inches apart  anyway. \n\nOne more insult was that we were required to sign a contract stating that we would pay whatever they charged and had to put up a credit card number as a retainer. Again, if we were two tables that kind of nonsense would not have been our burden. We only had a verbal from them that if we were not happy with something, they would adjust. But the contract did NOT reflect their verbal assurance. This went against every grain of business instinct that I have. I voted to go elsewhere but was outvoted by the better half of the nuptial party. \n\nLong story short, I usually tip 20% and would have for the service and food we received. But the nickel and dime bullshit extra charges under whatever name they want to call it is just that...bullshit!!\n\nOne more thing, I researched their wine list. It was average to good. But nothing stellar. I suggest bringing your own wine. Their prices for average wine are disgusting and the prices go up from there. The cork fees are exhorbinant also, but a better deal for better wine if u are inclined to bring and appreciate."

Being dinner time and being hungry a steakhouse sounded perfect so we decided to eat here. At first I was a little put off by the size of the place because this place was GIANT!!! Experience has taught me a big restaurant does not equal good food, but after passing by a few peoples tables my mind was quickly changing. We decided sit outside as the evening was gorgeous. The view we had was AWESOME!!! We sat along the strip with a view of the Bellagio. The Bellagio fountains provided an amazing show that was most enjoyable during our dinner. We were sitting on the inside patio, maybe ten feet from the street, and only heard 1 police car while we were sitting there. It was very quiet considering a heavy flow of traffic going down the Blvd. Just more of the magic of Las Vegas I suppose but we were very comfortable out there.\n\nI had the Filet Mignon with garlic spinach, my fiancee had the steak bordelaise with mashed potatoes. We had escargot as an appetizer, just because we were in Las Vegas. Not having any experience with escargot, I wasnt sure what to expect, certainly the emerald green color was a surprise. They were heavy on the butter and garlic which is always a good thing!!! The texture was similar tender calamari and reminded me of a seafood dish.\n\nMy fiancees steak was delicious as was mine. They were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouth. Our only MINOR gripe was the potatoes were a bit bland, no big deal. The rest of the food was so flavorful its probably the only reason we noticed. Our waiter was prompt and courteous as was his assistant. We had a great time Mon Ami Gabi!"

The restaurant was clean and well maintained. The restrooms are out in the Casino area.\nOur food was delicious. My French onion soup was not as hot as I would have like it, but the flavor was good. One in our party ordered a Banana Foster and it was huge. This dessert was shared by others at the table.\nWe left about 6:30pm and there wasn't an empty seat in the restaurant. If you are not eating early reservation would be in order."

Well when we came to Vegas last week we had a fabulous lunch and terrific service from Stephane, who has a French accent that is REAL! She helped us with menu choices and was so warm and welcoming. We even got a hug upon leaving. The Chicken Brie sandwich is delicious, as was the seafood crepe and skate wing. Ask for your fries well done and they are superb. Great atmosphere and on our next trip to Vegas, we will visit our new French friend Stephanie! Well done."

I will never come back again. \nThe MOST HORRIBLE SERVICE that I have seen. The server ignored us twice when we are talking to him. Threw the dishes instead of placing them on the table. Never came to add more water and i couldn't have them to do so since they always ignored us. However, it was interesting that they could always saw the tables behind and next us and knew what they needed. The worst restaurant that I will never ever come back again."

  "text" : "Wow! That is one of the best French restaurants I've ever been to (including a few in Paris). Everything was top-notch! We had a lovely lunch there and it's all thanks to you, dear yelp users! I researched few places nearby and Mon Ami Gabi had so many good reviews that I decided on trying it right away. \n\nFirst impression - this place is enormous! We wanted to sit on a patio and to get there we went trough three or four different dining rooms. The view outside is great, as the restaurant is facing Bellagio and its beautiful fountains. The staff was very nice and organized, we were promptly seated and handed menus. A lot of dishes seemed appetizing so it took a while to order. \n\nFor a starter we shared goat cheese and snails in garlic, butter and herbs. Both were simply delicious! Escargot were best I ever had and goat cheese came with creamy tomato sauce and fresh and crispy baguette. Mmm... Next we all ordered onion soup. It was very nicely prepared, with the melted cheese on the top. I don't know why I ordered it as I absolutely hate french onion soup. It must have been peer pressure :D. However, it was still one of the most passable onion soups I ate. And others like it very much, so it's probably great. After the first course we were already pretty full, but we made a mistake of ordering everything at once, so a few minutes later spinach and salmon salad with walnuts and blueberries arrived before me. And it was a surprising dish. In my opinion a salmon salad always consist of lots of small salmon pieces, not one big hunk of fish and all the other stuff next to it. It was more of the size of the main course and should have been named 'salmon and salad' not 'salmon salad'. But it's all semantics. Walnuts and blueberries gave the dish a refreshing taste, and even though I didn't manage to finish it, it was still very tasty. Our friends decided on salmon tatar with chips and it was probably the weakest part of the meal, but still not bad. It just lacked some herbs or spices. During our visit we also drank a lot of lemonade. At the beginning I made a mistake of ordering home made tea. In Poland, where I live, it always taste sweet, however, as I quickly learned, in America it's just regular tea, only cold. It did not taste good. The waiter was so nice, that upon noticing my mistake, she proposed switching it for sweet lemonade right away. And she didn't even put the tea on the bill. \n\nWe left the place full and content. Looking back, it was probably one of the best restaurants I visited during the stay. Definitely recommend."

We came at 1030 am on a Sunday.\n\nWe were seated in a perfect little spot, staring out towards the Bellagio fountains. The sun was warm and the air was chilly. Just perfect. The service was just awesome. Our servers came to chat us up, and all our requests were tended to quickly.\n\nI got a bacon, egg and cheese crepe. Needed more bacon but it had the most delectable cream sauce.  Hubby had a croissant breakfast sammy to which he added bacon. Now that was a huge, delicious sammy!! The bacon was thick cut and tasty.

The escargot was tender and the pesto sauce was buttery and tasty. The fresh bread went well with the pesto sauce.  The bread is perfect, crunchy on the outside, soft and slightly sour on the inside.\n\nWe had a great time, so much so that my friend forgot her credit card.  We're thankful they kept it for us.  When my friend went to pick up the card, there was a note asking for tip?! Did they want a tip for holding her credit card? We left the waitress a 15% tip. I've been a server before.  At no time is it ever acceptable to request tip from anyone! My friend felt mortified and so embarrassed when they asked her for tip.\n\nWe were excited and talked about going back for lunch or dinner on our next trip, but we'll try other restaurants first.  Sucks because we really liked the food.\n\n5 Stars\n-1 server was not friendly\n-2 for a lack of tipping etiquette"

I ended up eating here for every meal during my three day visit which may sound strange, but with the excellent food and great service I received, it was totally worth it. Anything you order here will be delicious. You just can't go wrong. I ordered a Cobb salad for my lunch on the second day, and it was the best Cobb salad I've ever had. And I've had a lot of Cobb salads in my day. All the servers I had for my many meals here were excellent. Everybody was friendly and knowledgable, and most importantly, didn't question why I came in for every meal over a three day span. Great place, and will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas!"

The soup was not too salty and the melted cheese mixed well with the onions. It's a large serving, but I make it dissappear in seconds! On to the main course...the steak! I chose the boned in ribeye!

My friend got a Bloody Mary and saw a cockroach running across the make your own Bloody Mary bar. Not only is this unsanitary but also ruins your appetite by causing us to question the cleanliness of the restaurant. The manager did come by and apologize and offered dessert on the house so they definitely get points for service. However, still unacceptable to have little roaches running around in a nice Las Vegas restaurant :("

Loved the baguette they brought out but didn't really try the carrot salad that was also complimentary. All 3 in our party ordered steaks with frites. They were divine. Tender, cooked to perfection. The frites complemented the dish well. Good wine selection. Fabulous experience."

A nice, relatively affordable French steakhouse located facing the Bellagio fountains.\n\nService is great. Food is great. Come for brunch or dinner, and sit on the patio!\n\nTIP: You can not book a reservation for the patio, but I always request the Garden room behind the patio. Luckily, the staff has been very accommodating with this request! It sits just beside the patio and will protect you on cold days. On nice days, the walls come up, and you feel like you're outside. \n\nYou're welcome. ;)"

  "text" : "came here for lunch on a sunday morning, and my table of 7 was sat almost immediately on the heated patio. there's a dark inner area, inside patio area (glass walls/roof) and then an outside patio area with a generous amount of heat lamps and seats where you can people watch everyone on the strip while enjoying your meal.\ni got the croissant sandwich with turkey and avocado and the rest of my family got the salad, eggs benedict, and spinach omelette. prices were relatively cheap considering this was a restaurant on the strip in a steakhouse, and all food tasted not bad. the portions were probably the perfect amount for lunch: not too much but not too little. given the great service and the ambiance of our meal, i bumped a 3 star meal up to 4 stars. this is a great place to have breakfast or lunch on the patio on a clear Paradise morning :)"

  "text" : "Hmm I like the authentic feel of the setting and view of the Bellagio fountain, on the heated patio seals the deal.  I commented that it does remind me of Paris, so there you go.\n\nBoar Ragu was EXCELLENT, so was the filet mignon.\nEscargots very tiny and not the best i have ever had, but thats okay.  We can't all be winners.\n\nService slightly unattentive, but overall a successful trip to this spot.  Good for date night! :)"

  "text" : "Twice we ate at Mon Ami Gabi, a french restaurant located in the Paris hotel & casino across from the Bellagio. Both times we were fortunate to get front-row seating outside on the terrace facing the famous Las Vegas Strip.\n\nService was excellent and the prices were reasonable given its location. Brunch and lunch items were $10 to $15 each. You can see the fountains of the Bellagio while you're having dinner. When you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter. I ordered a glass of wine and a steak sandwich. The service was excellent as was the food. The waiters are really trying to make you have a great evening. Highly recommended!"

  "text" : "We chose this place based on the good rating on Yelp but it turned out to be a very bad choice. There was 9 of us some of whom on their own and some in couple. When we told the waiter we were splitting the check he first brought us a series of wrong checks and on asking to correct them he seemed to get frustrated and started to treat us rudely. I went to talk to the manager but he didn't behave the way I expected and told me we should have told the waiter at the beginning. He apologized at the end but he didn't seem to be  concerned about us as his customers. BTW, the food was just ordinary."
