##Model scripts

This folder contains scripts that define and initialize the structure of each of the models that were tested, including
VGG-16, VGG-19 and GoogleNet. We also include the script for Inception_v3 but this model did not work. Scripts that do
not have a usage defined are mostly helper scripts called from other scripts or have hard-coded parameters.

### Structure

In this section, we describe the functionality of each script:
* `__init__.py`: This file is empty and it is only included as a requirement for all packages.
